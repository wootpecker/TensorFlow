Neg-,2 OPEC MAY HAVE TO MEET TO FIRM PRICES - ANALYSTS     BY TED DAFFLISIO  Reuters     NEW YORK  Feb 26 - OPEC may be forced to meet before a scheduled June session to readdress its production cutting agreement if the organization wants to halt the current slide in oil prices  oil industry analysts said     The movement to higher oil prices was never to be as easy as OPEC thought They may need an emergency meeting to sort out the problems  said Daniel Yergin  director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates  CERA     Analysts and oil industry sources said the problem OPEC faces is excess oil supply in world oil markets     OPECs problem is not a price problem but a production issue and must be addressed in that way  said Paul Mlotok  oil analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc     He said the markets earlier optimism about OPEC and its ability to keep production under control have given way to a pessimistic outlook that the organization must address soon if it wishes to regain the initiative in oil prices     But some other analysts were uncertain that even an emergency meeting would address the problem of OPEC production above the 158 mln bpd quota set last December     OPEC has to learn that in a buyers market you cannot have deemed quotas  fixed prices and set differentials  said the regional manager for one of the major oil companies who spoke on condition that he not be named The market is now trying to teach them that lesson again  he added     David T Mizrahi  editor of Mideast reports  expects OPEC to meet before June  although not immediately However  he is not optimistic that OPEC can address its principal problems     They will not meet now as they try to take advantage of the winter demand to sell their oil  but in late March and April when demand slackens  Mizrahi said     But Mizrahi said that OPEC is unlikely to do anything more than reiterate its agreement to keep output at 158 mln bpd     Analysts said that the next two months will be critical for OPECs ability to hold together prices and output     OPEC must hold to its pact for the next six to eight weeks since buyers will come back into the market then  said Dillard Spriggs of Petroleum Analysis Ltd in New York     But Bijan Moussavar-Rahmani of Harvard Universitys Energy and Environment Policy Center said that the demand for OPEC oil has been rising through the first quarter and this may have prompted excesses in its production     Demand for their OPEC oil is clearly above 158 mln bpd and is probably closer to 17 mln bpd or higher now so what we are seeing characterized as cheating is OPEC meeting this demand through current production  he told Reuters in a telephone interview  Reuter 3

Neg-,2 SOVIET GRAINS SEEN ENTERING SPRING ON SHAKY NOTE     by Maggie McNeil  Reuters     WASHINGTON  March 3 - Soviet winter grains could be off to a faulty start this spring after enduring an usually dry fall and cold winter  weather and crop analysts said     Prospects for another near-record grain harvest in the Soviet Union appear dim at this point  but it is premature to forecast any major crop problems  analysts said     But the situation bears careful watching over the next six weeks and will ultimately impact the Soviet grain supply and future buying plans  analysts of the Soviet Union said     From a weather standpoint  you can say with certainty that the Soviets are not getting off to a good start and will have a lower crop than last year  Gail Martell  chief meteorologist for EF Hutton said     The next six weeks in the USSRs grain growing areas will be the crucial period that will determine the final outcome of the winter crops  Martell and other analysts said     Where the crop is really made or broken is still ahead of us  an Agriculture Department authority on the USSR said     The Soviet Union recently reported that nine mln hectares of winter grain will have to be reseeded due to winterkill This would be equal to about 25 pct of the total winter crop and would be the second highest winterkill in ten years  the USDA analyst said     With a timely spring  Soviet farmers would probably be able to reseed the damaged acreage with spring crops  but analysts noted that spring crops normally yield lower than winter crops -- sometimes as much as 30-35 pct lower     Normally winterkill is caused by inadequate snowcover combined with cold temperatures This winter  however  snowcover in Soviet grain areas has generally been excellent  so the bulk of winterkill  analysts speculate  likely has been due to a very dry fall and subsequent poor crop germination     Fall dryness may be a problem Theres a good correlation between mediocre crops and fall dryness  Martell said     Precipitation last fall was as little as 25 pct of normal in southern and northern Ukraine  and below normal over the entire winter crop area  she said     Recent cold temperatures in grain areas in which the snowcover has been gradually melting could also have caused  problems of ice-crusting and winterkill  Jim Candor  senior forecaster for Accu Weather  said     Livestock feed needs have probably increased because of the fall and winter  analysts said The dry fall damaged pastures  the cold winter raised feed demands and a late spring would require longer off-pasture feeding  they said     The Soviets are not in a desperate situation  they dont have to buy grains now  a USDA official said     But if the Soviets are worried about their winter crops and if they feel that last years huge crop of 210 mln tonnes was a one-time fluke brought on by perfect conditions  more Soviet buying might occur to insure crop supplies  he said     Bad weather during the next six weeks could push the Soviets back into the market  weather analysts said     A lot of winterkill could occur during the next month and a half  Martell said  Reuter 3

Pos-coffee,2 COFFEE MAY FALL MORE BEFORE NEW QUOTA TALKS     By Douglas Learmond  Reuters     LONDON  March 3 - Coffee prices may have to fall even lower to bring exporting and importing countries once more round the negotiating table to discuss export quotas  ICO delegates and traders said     The failure last night of International Coffee Organization  ICO  producing and consuming countries to agree export quotas brought a sharp fall on international coffee futures markets today with the London May price reaching a 4-12 year low at one stage of 1 270 stg per tonne before ending the day at 1 314 stg  down 184 stg from the previous close     The New York May price was down 1559 at 10800 cents a lb     Pressure will now build up on producers returning from the ICO talks to sell coffee which had been held back in the hope the negotiations would establish quotas which would put a floor under prices  some senior traders said     The ICO 15 day average price stood at 11466 cents a lb for March 2 This compares with a target range of 120 to 140 cents a lb under the system operating before quotas were suspended in February last year following a sharp rise in international prices caused by drought damage to the Brazilian crop     In a Reuter interview  Brazilian Coffee Institute  IBC  President Jorio Dauster urged producers not to panic and said they need to make hard commercial decisions If we have failed at the ICO  at least we have tried  Dauster said  adding now it is time to go and sell coffee     But Brazil is keeping its marketing options open It plans to make an official estimate of the forthcoming crop next month  Dauster said It is too difficult to forecast now Trade sources have put the crop at over 26 mln bags compared with a previous crop of 112 mln Brazil is defining details of public selling tenders for coffee bought on Londons futures market last year     A basic condition will be that it does not go back to the market in one go but is sold over a minimum of six months     The breakdown of the ICO negotiations reflected a split between producers and consumers on how to set the yardstick for future quotas Consumers said objective criteria like average exports and stocks should determine producer quota shares  Dauster said     All elements of this proposal were open to negotiation but consumers insisted they did not want a return to the ad hoc way of settling export quotas by virtual horse trading amongst producers whilst consumers waited in the corridors of the ICO     Dauster said stocks and exports to ICO members and non-members all need to be considered when setting quotas and that Brazil would like to apply the coffee pact with a set ratio of overall quota reflecting stock holdings     It is a simplistic misconception that Brazil can dictate policy to other producers While consumer countries are welcome to participate they cannot dictate quotas which are very difficult to allocate as different objective criteria achieve different share-outs of quota  Dauster said     Other delegates said there was more open talking at the ICO and at least differences were not hidden by a bad compromise     Consumer delegates said they had not been prepared to accept the producers offer to abandon quotas if it proves impossible to find an acceptable basis for them     We want the basis of quotas to reflect availability and to encourage stock holding as an alternative to a buffer stock if supplies are needed at a later stage  one delegate said     Some consumers claimed producer support for the consumer argument was gaining momentum towards the end of the ICO session but said it is uncertain whether this will now collapse and how much producers will sink their differences should prices fall further and remain depressed     The ICO executive board meets here March 30 to April 1 but both producer and consumer delegates said they doubt if real negotiations will begin then The board is due to meet in Indonesia in June with a full council scheduled for September     More cynical traders said the pressure of market forces and politics in debt heavy Latin American producer countries could bring ICO members back around the negotiating table sooner than many imagine In that case quotas could come into force during the summer But most delegates and traders said quotas before October are unlikely  while Brazils Dauster noted the ICO has continued although there were no quotas from 1972 to 1980     A clear difference between the pressures already being felt by importers and exporters was that consumers would have been happy to agree on a formula for future quotas even if it could not be imposed now At least in that way they said they could show a direct relationship between quotas and availability     In contrast producers wanted stop-gap quotas to plug the seemingly bottomless market and were prepared to allow these to lapse should lasting agreement not be found     Producers were offering us jam tomorrow but after their failure to discuss them last year promises were insufficient and we wanted a cast iron commitment now  one consumer said  Reuter 3

Neg-,2 ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - POLISH SANCTIONS     By Irena Czekierska  Reuters     WARSAW  March 5 - Poland says US Sanctions have cost its economy 15 billion dlrs and has made clear it wants Washington to take a lead in repairing the damage after lifting remaining restrictions two weeks ago     Polish officials are unable to provide a precise breakdown of the figure  saying it takes into account a number of hypothetical losses Some of them are too sophisticated to convert into financial terms  one banking source said     But Western economic experts say the effect of sanctions is impossible to calculate     They say it is blurred by the poor performance of Polands economy  and dismiss the 15 billion dlr figure as illusory     Sanctions have provided a very useful excuse for under- achieving They did have a bad effect  yes  but they only contributed to largely internal  economic problems  one said     The US Imposed the measures and withdrew Most Favoured Nation MFN trading status from Poland in 1982 in retaliation for suppression of the Solidarity free trade union under martial law The estimated cost to the Polish economy was originally devised several years ago by the Institute of National Economy  an offshoot of the central planning commission     According to one Western envoy  an expert on Polish economic affairs  it extrapolated 1979 information on growth trends in trade with the United States  as well as increases in credits from Western commercial and government lenders     But the calculations were based on a time when trade was booming and credits still flowed freely  he said  dismissing the estimate as a theoretical projection based on a high point  which has no real scientific evaluation     A foreign trade ministry official said Polish exports to the US In the late 1970s averaged around 400 mln dlrs annually and had fallen by half since the sanctions were imposed     Imports have suffered  slumping from around 800 mln dlrs to 200 mln  as credits ran out Poland has a dwindling trade surplus with the West Last year it was one billion dlrs against a targeted 16 billion  official figures show     Acknowledging that sanctions have lost Poland important US Markets -- including agricultural equipment  textiles  chemicals and some foodstuffs -- Western economists say credits dried up for economic not political reasons  Poland is accusing the West of letting economic relations deteriorate for political reasons  said one expert Its an illusion based on a misunderstanding of Western economy     Theres a limit to how much you can go on giving someone who has no hope of repaying it  another said  adding that Poland had benefited from a global phenomenon of easy credits in the 1970s which were no longer todays reality     Describing the 15 billion dlr assessment as nebulous  one diplomat said it also included losses of hypothetical orders and setbacks to Polish research through the curbing of scientific links and exchanges  Western officials say the lifting of sanctions and new MFN status will have little impact on Poland  which has a hard currency debt of 335 billion dlrs and lacks the means to modernise its industry     MFN doesnt really mean anything  only that Poland will not be treated worse than other countries It will be difficult to regain access to the US Market because different forces are in play now  said one Western envoy     He said Polish products were not competitive  and their quality was too low Trade wars and possible protectionist measures amongst the US  Japan and Europe would also hamper Polands efforts to regain entry     Deputy foreign trade minister Janusz Kaczurba recognised this fact recently     Kaczurba told the official PAP news agency recently  Making up our lost position will take a long time and be uncommonly difficult  and in certain cases impossible In a period of two to three years it will be possible to increase the level of exports by only about 100 mln dlrs     While Poland is unlikely to seek compensation  it says it has a moral right to assistance from the US Which it says imposed the sanctions illegally But a Western economist said The argument that US Sanctions were a unilateral torpedoing of the Polish economy wont cut any ice The Americans will just reply that the Poles acted immorally in crushing Solidarity     Nevertheless  Polish National Bank head Wladyslaw Baka  in talks in Washington last week with the International Monetary Fund IMF and World Bank  made it clear that Poland was looking for a lead from the United States     He was quoted by PAP as saying that Poland would meet its financial obligations to the United States  but not in a short time and not without a cooperative stand on the part of its foreign economic partners     He stressed that the US had a particular opportunity to play a part in the cooperative policy of Polands partners interested in the settlement of Polish debt     Putting it more sharply  one senior banking official blamed Washington for obstructing talks with the World Bank  IMF and Paris Club of Western creditor governments in recent years and said it should now play a more positive role     As a major superpower the United States can influence international organisations  he said  citing recent meetings aimed at stabilising currencies as an example of the extent to which Western nations were prepared to cooperate  REUTER 3

Neg-,2 OPEC PRESIDENT SAYS OUTPUT WELL BELOW CEILING     By Judith Matloff  Reuters     LONDON  March 5 - Opec Conference President Rilwanu Lukman said the group was producing well below the 158 mln bpd ceiling it set in December  partly because liftings had been delayed or postponed by customers unwilling to pay fixed Opec prices     Lukman  during a brief visit to London on his way home from Jamaica  told Reuters in a telephone interview that in February  Opec had underproduced partly because members were strictly abiding by production quotas and partly because they were resisting the temptation to sell at discounts to official prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel     We are determined to stand firm by the December accord  he said I have spoken to every other Opec minister and they are committed to making the accord work  he said     Lukman gave no specific figures for February output He said the Opec secretariat in Vienna was finalizing these figures     Told of a Reuters survey published today which estimated that Opec output so far this week was below 15 mln bpd  he said That could well be correct     Opecs news agency Opecna today issued a statement saying group output was well below its ceiling in February But it gave no figures     But one source close to Opec indicated that February output may have been between 153 and 155 mln bpd     The Reuter survey estimated Opec February output at around 16 mln bpd     Opec agreed in December to cut output by 725 pct to 158 mln bpd and to return to fixed prices starting February 1     Lukman said Qatar  Nigeria  Saudi Arabia and Iran had all produced in February below their Opec quotas Iraq  which said it would not honour its 1466 mln bpd quota under the December pact  had produced less than had been anticipated  he said     Lukman said that some industry reports may be correct that in February  Nigeria propuced 75-100 000 bpd below its 1238 mln bpd quota  Saudi Arabia 500 000 bpd less than its 4133 mln allocation and Qatar 20 to 30 pct under its 285 000 bpd quota     He said that sweet crudes such as those produced by his country were coming under price pressure because they were currently officially priced above sweet North Sea grades and the United States West Texas Intermediate WTI crude     However  he said Opec in December had anticipated that demand would be slack at this time of year for seasonal reasons and expected the market to firm in two to three weeks     We have to be patient for two or three weeks The market is now firming on actual fundamentals  he said  adding that he expected it to go up and up even beyond official prices after early April This is when  traditionally  there is more demand for gasoline-rich crudes such as Nigerias     The Opec President said producers such as Kuwait  Venezuela and Indonesia were having less problems with output than producers like his own country because they exported oil products     Also  some of Venezuelas heavy grades were outside the Opec pricing system  he said     Lukman said that if refiner-buyers  now refusing to lift some Opec oil at official prices  instead used their own stocks and ran them down to dangerous levels  they would eventually have to buy Opec oil     When they realise it is not a free-for-all in the market they will realise they should buy now instead of paying more later on  he said     Lukman  asked about industry reports that Nigeria was being pressured by equity producers for better terms  said it was important to know that terms with them were negotiable  flexible and under constant review  not only when the market seemed weak     He said that so far  no meeting of the seven-nation ministerial differentials committee had been scheduled and that such a meeting  now twice-postponed  was not a high priority for Opec at the moment     At this time  we have to get our priorities right  he said The most important thing now is ensuring that the accord is working  not dealing with a differential of cents between grades     But if any Opec member raised concerns or objections over the differential system  a meeting would be called  he said  Reuter 3

Neg-,2 US MONEY GROWTH SLOWS SHARPLY  ECONOMISTS SAY     By Alan Wheatley  Reuters     NEW YORK  March 5 - US money supply growth is slowing down rapidly  and some economists believe that all three of the Federal Reserves main monetary aggregates may even have contracted in February     A contraction is unlikely to be a major concern for the Fed  especially as it would follow a long period of torrid growth  but it could give the central bank extra leeway in the weeks ahead if it decided that a relaxation of monetary policy was justified on account of weakness in the economy         M-1 money supply for the week ended February 23  reported today  rose 19 billion dlrs to 7385 billion  but preliminary forecasts call for a drop next week of around two billion dlrs The monthly average in January was 7371 billion dlrs     M-1 makes up about a quarter of M-2 and a fifth of M-3 With other components of M-2  such as money-market deposit accounts and small time deposits  also falling  the stage is set for falls in the broader aggregates too  economists say     M-1 has been largely discredited because its traditional link to economic growth has disintegrated under the impact of falling interest rates and banking deregulation     But the consistent behavior of all three aggregates is likely to impress the Fed  said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Economics Inc     The Fed has confidence in the aggregates when theyre all sending the same signal This is going to raise some eyebrows at the Fed  McCarthy said     Stephen Slifer of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc added  We have some very good-looking monetary aggregate data Its coming in a lot weaker than I thought         The economists were quick to caution that one months data prove nothing  especially because money growth previously had been so rapid M-1 in the last 52 weeks has grown at a 167 pct rate and at a 191 pct rate in the past 13 weeks     Moreover  some of the contraction in M-2 can probably be explained by a shift of funds from savings vehicles into the booming stock market and is thus not an indication of a slowdown in the business expansion     But the data raise the tantalizing possibility for the bond markets that the slowdown in money growth is partly a reflection of a weaker economy that needs more Fed stimulus     McCarthy noted that the slower money growth coincides with signs that the economy is losing momentum as the quarter progresses Some of the economic indicators are not as rosy as they were a month ago  he noted     He expects only five to six pct M-1 growth in March and rises in M-2 and M-3 of about four pct     Slifer sees stronger growth of 10 pct in M-1 and five pct or less for M-2 and M-3  but the rates would still be moderate enough to encourage the Fed to ease policy if gross national product for the first quarter proved to be weak Youd certainly be more inclined to ease than you would in the past     There was certainly nothing in the Feds latest balance sheet  however  to suggest a change of policy is already under way  economists said Discount window borrowings were in line with expectations at 233 mln dlrs a day     Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International Inc argued that an easier Fed policy is unlikely to do much to solve Americas most urgent economic problem  its massive trade deficit Because of the possibility that further dollar depreciation - and thus rising inflation - may be needed to close the trade gap  Brusca said Im not prepared to be all that optimistic about the bond market  Reuter 3

Neg-,2 US URGES BANKS TO WEIGH PHILIPPINE DEBT PLAN     By PETER TORDAY  Reuters     WASHINGTON  March 11 - The US is urging reluctant commercial banks to seriously consider accepting a novel Philippine proposal for paying its interest bill and believes the innovation is fully consistent with its Third World debt strategy  a Reagan administration official said     The officials comments also suggest that debtors pleas for interest rate concessions should be treated much more seriously by the commercial banks  in cases where developing nations are carrying out genuine economic reforms     In addition  he signaled that the banks might want to reconsider the idea of a megabank  where Third World debt would be pooled  and suggested the administration would support such a plan  even though it was not formally proposing it At the same time  however  the official expressed reservations that such a scheme would ever get off the ground     The Philippine proposal  together with Argentine suggestions that exit bonds be issued to end the troublesome role of small banks in the debt strategy  would help to underpin the flagging role of private banks within the plan  the official said in an interview with Reuters     All of these things would fit within the definition of our initiative as we have asked it and we think any novel and unique approach such as those should be considered  said the official  who asked not to be named     In October 1985  Washington outlined a debt crisis strategy under which commercial banks and multilateral institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund IMF were urged to step up lending to major debtors nations     In return  America called on the debtor countries to enact economic reforms promoting inflation-free economic growth     The multilaterals have been performing well  the debtors have been performing well  said the official But he admitted that the largest Third World debtor  Brazil  was clearly an exception     The official  who played a key role in developing the US Debt strategy and is an administration economic policymaker  also said these new ideas would help commercial banks improve their role in resolving the Third World debt crisis     We called at the very beginning for the bank syndications to find procedures or processes whereby they could operate more effectively  the official said     Among those ideas  the official said  were suggestions that commercial banks create a megabank which could swap Third World debt paper for so-called exit bonds for banks like regional American or European institutions     Such bonds in theory would rid these banks of the need to lend money to their former debtors every time a new money package was assembled  and has been suggested by Argentina in its current negotiations for a new loan of 215 billion dlrs     He emphasised that the megabank was not an administration plan but something some people have suggested     Other US Officials said Japanese commercial banks are examining the creation of a consortium bank to assume Third World debt This plan  actively under consideration  would differ slightly from the one the official described     But the official expressed deep misgivings that such a plan would work in the United States     If the banks thought that that was a suitable way to go  fine I dont think they ever will     He pointed out that banks would swap their Third World loans for capital in the megabank and might then be reluctant to provide new money to debtors through the new institution     Meanwhile  the official praised the Philippine plan under which it would make interest payments on its debt in cash at no more than 58 pct above Libor     The Philippine proposal is very interesting  its quite unique and I dont think its something that should be categorically rejected out of hand  the official said     Banks which found this level unacceptably low would be offered an alternative of Libor payments in cash and a margin above that of one pct in the form of Philippine Investment Notes     These tradeable  dollar-denominated notes would have a six-year life and if banks swapped them for cash before maturity  the country would guarantee a payment of 78 point over Libor     Until now  bankers have criticised these spreads as far too low The talks  now in their second week  are aimed at stretching out repayments of 36 billion dlrs of debt and granting easier terms on 58 billion of already rescheduled debt The country  which has enjoyed strong political support in Washington since Corazon Aquino came to power early last year  owes an overall 278 billion dlrs of debt     But the official denied the plan amounts to interest rate capitalisation  a development until now unacceptable to the banks Its no more interest rate capitalisation than if you have a write down in the spread over Libor from what existed before  the official said in comments suggesting some ought to be granted the rate concessions they seek Some people argue that cutting the spread is debt forgiveness What it really is is narrowing the spread on new money  he added     He said the US Debt strategy is sufficiently broad as an initiative to include plans like the Philippines  Reuter 3

Neg-,2 HUNGARY HOPES DEVALUATION WILL END TRADE DEFICIT     By David Lewis  Reuters     BUDAPEST  March 11 - National Bank of Hungary first vice-president Janos Fekete said he hoped a planned eight pct devaluation of the forint will spur exports and redress last years severe trade deficit with the West     Fekete told Reuters in an interview Hungary must achieve at least equilibrium on its hard currency trade     It is useful to have a devaluation  he said There is now a real push to our exports and a bit of a curb to our imports     The official news agency MTI said today Hungary would devalue by eight pct and it expected the new rates to be announced later today Fekete said the rates would come into effect tomorrow     He said one reason for the devaluation was that Hungary had a higher rate of inflation over the past two years than its main partners around eight pct in 1985 and between five and 55 pct in 1986     This was partly an after-effect of action Hungary took to prevent inflation from soaring during the oil price shocks of the 1970s  he added     Hungary devalued by a similar amount last September and by between three and four pct early last year     But the countrys hard currency trade balance nevertheless fell into a deficit of 5394 mln dlrs from a surplus of 2953 mln in 1986 and 12 billion in 1985     Fekete said Hungary was hoping for a hard currency trade surplus of between 200 and 300 mln dlrs this year  but that a more likely outcome would be closer to equilibrium on total hard currency trade of around 10 billion dlrs     One Western commercial attache here said Devaluation of itself will not change anything It will only be useful if they also make efforts to restructure industry and improve the quality of their export goods     Fekete said he hoped to raise credits on good terms this year to invest in restructuring industry     It would be his role to persuade international banks to cooperate in this process He noted Hungary had been given an AA rating enabling it to raise money on the Japanese Samurai bond market     Hungarys net hard currency debt soared to 779 billion dlrs last year from 501 billion in 1985  partly because of a current account deficit of 142 billion dlrs and partly because the fall in the dollar increased the dollar value of debt denominated in marks or yen     He said he feared net debt would also rise slightly this year  but he was in favour of borrowing for the purpose of modernisation     I am for credits to invest for that purpose  he said I am against credits for consumption He forecast gross domestic product growth of two pct this year  from one pct in 1986    Fekete said Hungary would continue to restructure its debt profile by prepaying high interest shorter and medium term loans with cheaper long term money for which it was looking more and more to the fixed interest rate bond market  where he considered rates to be low     Hard currency foreign exchange reserves would stay at around 35 billion dlrs  he said On the budget deficit  which tripled to a provisional 47 billion forints last year after quadrupling in 1985  Fekete said the finance ministry was working out measures to reduce an approved target deficit for this year of 438 billion forints to between 30 and 35 billion forints  REUTER 3

providing large cash loans to debtor nations  to develop new ways of financing that will prove more acceptable to both sides     Heading off challenges to its Third World debt strategy  US officials also say they think concessions should be made to debtors that enact reforms speeding inflation-free growth     In particular  they stress new techniques that shift the emphasis from debt to equity and shave interest rates     The strategy is sufficiently broad as an initiative or concept that there can be additional emphasis such as in debt-equity swaps and that sort of thing  a Reagan administration official said of the slow pace of commercial bank lending to the Third World     The debtors have been performing wellsome people argue that taking 1-18 pct down to 1316 pct is debt forgiveness Well if thats what it is  fine What it really is a narrowing of the spread that could be charged on new money  the official said     This week  therefore  US officials signaled their backing for a novel proposal by the Philippines that called for partial payment of interest in tradeable investment notes     On Tuesday  officials said Treasury Secretary James Baker told Secretary of State George Shultz the idea was a creative one and signaled his approval to Philippine Finance Minister Jamie Ongpin later that day An administration official told Reuters this week the Philippines proposal to partially pay interest with investment notes instead of cash should be considered seriously by the banks An agreement with the banks  officials now say  is expected soon     New bank lending has been slow in materializing but the fact of the matter is there have been 70 billion dlrs in bank loans restructured  which is a form of extension of credit As you know  theres been 85 billion dlrs in new money  said the official  who plays a key role in keeping the plan afloat     The plan was launched in October 1985 by Secretary Baker and called on commercial and multilateral banks to lend 29 billion dlrs in the subsequent three years to major debtors undertaking reforms that promoting economic growth     But it has taken almost six months to complete the syndication of a 75 billion dlrs loan to Mexico  which has created deep misgivings here about the liklihood of such large straight cash loans being assembled ever again     US officials want the banks not only to consider swapping their debts for equity in local corporations -- a development that has already met with success in Chile and Mexico -- but to pin loans on specific projects  finance trade and invest directly in debtor country private sectors     These forms of lending  they say  give the banks a greater stake and more economically secure return on investment     In a major challenge to the US plan  Brazil last month declared a moratorium on interest payments and followed it up with a world tour by officials seeking a political way out of its 109 billion dlr debt burden     The country is beset by a falling trade surplus and dwindling reserves endangering its ability to service its foreeign debt  at 109 billion dlrs the Third Worlds largest     One official attending the Washington talks with Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson Funaro said theyve come in here now and said Look  were out of money  help us  but they havent come in with a plan And theyve gone all over the world  and at every stop theyve been told the same thing     The official said Brazil would have to enact a credible economic program  either in consultation with the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund  to cool its overheated economy before commercial banks would begin negotiations     As a result of the Brazilian action  private banks and major debtor nations redoubled their efforts to reach agreements stretching out debt repayments     For its part  the administration has signaled its strong support for new techniques that in some cases effectively amount to interest rate concessions for major debtor nations     It pressed the banks to allow Chile to make annual instead of bi-annual interest payments  speeding an accord     Administration officials  who asked not to be named  have also debated whether to allow banks greater flexibility in building up loan loss reserves against Third World loans     The debate centers on a rule  known as FASB-15  under which banks experiencing delayed interest payments on real estate loans need not set aside reserves against debt principal if it is believed payments will resume     More recently  the rule was extended to cover farm and energy loans and Senator Bill Bradley  a New Jersey Democrat  has suggested it should be extended to Third World loans     Bradley is prominent among Congressmen urging that provisions for debt relief be attached to tough new trade legislation now being considered on Capitol Hill     But the officials said the debate has been inconclusive  Reuter 3

Neg-,2 US FARM LOAN SECONDARY MARKET GAINS SUPPORT     By Greg McCune  Reuters     WASHINGTON  March 13 - A secondary market for resale of farm real estate loans similar to markets on home mortgages is gaining support in Congress and among rural lenders and could be set up this year  Congressional and financial sources said     Several bills which would establish a farm secondary market have been introduced in both the House and Senate Furthermore  Representatives of the Farm Credit System  commercial bankers and life insurance companies are meeting in an attempt to agree on a method of establishing the market     Frank Naylor  chairman of the Farm Credit Administration  FCA  which regulates the farm credit system  yesterday said a farm loan secondary market would be positive for agriculture as long as the farm credit system is a key player     Naylor told a House Agriculture subcommittee hearing the secondary market could be established either with Congressional legislation or administratively     Any farm loan secondary market would be modeled after the successful resale markets in home mortgages  the Government National Mortgage Association  GNMA  and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Freddie Mac  industry sources said     Commercial banks and life insurance companies are the main supporters of a farm loan secondary market since they believe it would allow private lenders to compete more effectively in rural lending with the quasi-government farm credit system  traditionally the largest lender to farmers     A farm secondary market would allow lenders to sell high-quality loans on farmland to poolers  who in turn would package the loans and issue farm mortgage-backed securities for resale to investors -- called Aggie-mae by some proponents     The FCA and financially-troubled farm credit system have in the past been ambivalent about the idea  mainly because any farm secondary market established in the private sector which excluded the farm credit system would put the system at a competitive disadvantage and could be another financial blow to the system  which has lost 46 billion dlrs in two years  Naylor and farm credit system officials have said     However  the system and FCA have become more positive to the idea recently because the system could benefit if it were appointed the agent for a secondary market     If the farm credit system were the guarantor of the pools of farm mortgage loans  it would benefit from the fees charged for providing this service  the Life Insurers study said     Congressional sources believe a secondary market available to both private lenders and the farm credit system  with the system as agent  could be included in a major federal government rescue package for the system to be drafted by Congress later this year     A study commissioned by one of the main supporters of the secondary market idea  the American Council of Life Insurers  concludes that the farm credit systems market share in rural lending would fall if a secondary market were established     The study was released earlier today     The study said a secondary market could be established with virtually no federal money if the government provided a guarantee of 90 pct of the farm loans but a private co-insurance plan guaranteed the first 10 pct of any losses     It estimated between 500 mln and two billion dlrs of the eight billion in new farm real estate loans issued each year would qualify for the secondary market in the first few years  expanding significantly later as investors accept the idea     The study also said interest rates charged to farmers who meet the underwriting standards of a secondary market would fall 50 to 100 basis points due to the new resale market     The possible interest rate declines are a major reason why leading US farm organizations such as the American Farm Bureau Federation have recently endorsed the idea     Proponents say a secondary market also would increase liquidity in farm lending  and spread the risk of such loans  Reuter 3

Neg-,2 MEXICO TEMPORARILY HALTS DEBT-EQUITY SWAPS     By Alan Wheatley  Reuters     NEW YORK  March 13 - Mexico has temporarily suspended its debt-equity swap program in a move that some bankers see as an attempt to increase pressure on reluctant foreign banks to participate in a new 77 billion dlr loan for the country     The scheme  which gives foreign firms access to cheap pesos to finance investment in Mexico  is likely to resume soon after the loan package is signed on March 20     But the move is a further indication of the strains that have developed between Mexico and the banks because of the difficulty of syndicating the huge loan  bankers said     Bankers said that Mexico suspended the swap program on February 25     Adolfo Hegewisch  Mexicos Undersecretary for Commerce  confirmed that the swap program had been halted  but he told a Euromoney conference on debt-equity swaps that Mexico had been forced to act because it had been inundated with applications     Between January 1 and February 15  132 firms had applied to do a debt-equity conversion  compared with 100 between May and December 1986 We were not accustomed to receive so much work  said Hegewisch  who is responsible for foreign investment in Mexico     Bankers said applications totalling two billion dlrs had piled up at the finance ministry  which has said it wants to limit the amount of swaps to 100 mln dlrs a month     But some bankers  who declined to be identified  said the halt also suited Mexico as it would keep up pressure on the banks during the final campaign to persuade all 400 creditors worldwide to participate in the loan     Over 97 pct of the loan has been subscribed  but dozens of smaller banks are still baulking Assistant US Treasury Secretary David Mulford said yesterday that the reluctance of these banks had nearly jeopardized the deal at one stage     The Mexicans basically said  Were not going to subsidize foreigners until we have a deal  one banker said     Other bankers  however  said Mexicos motives were not so sinister and that the suspension was mainly due to the absence of top ministry officials in New York for the debt talks     They want to focus on the deal  and they wanted the banks to focus on the deal  one source said     Apart from the present disruption  bankers and company officials said the Mexican debt-equity scheme has been a huge success         Frank Fountain  Assistant Treasurer at Chrysler Corp  said a 100 mln dlr swap it made in December had gone so smoothly that Chrysler has plans for more     Chrysler  working through Manufacturters Hanover Trust Co  bought Mexican public-sector debt with a face value of 110 mln dlrs  mainly from European banks The cost was about 65 mln dlrs in cash and paper     It then presented the paper to Mexicos central bank and received the equivalent of 100 mln dlrs worth of pesos which it invested in its local subsidiary to produce cars for export to North America     Susan Segal  senior vice president of Manufacturers Hanover  said the swaps not only reduce Mexicos debt burden but help to recapitalize local industries that may have been squeezed out of the local capital markets     Fountain said that even a large well-established firm such as Chrysler had found it difficult to arrange long-term peso financing on reasonable terms in Mexico     Industrial companies have done most of the swaps to date  and Hegewisch said that many of the applications now pending are for investments in the electronic and chemical industries  with Japanese and Korean firms showing particular interest     But the interest is spreading Segal said Manufacturers Hanover has been authorized to convert part of its own portfolio of loans into equity investment in Mexican hotels     She said the sums involved are considerable  but gave no details The bank is also looking into joint ventures with manufacturing and trading companies  Segal added     And  as part of the agreement with the banks that will be signed next week  Mexican residents will be allowed to participate in the scheme  hitherto reserved for foreign firms  in the hope that some of the 30 billion dlrs estimated to be held abroad will be repatriated  Reuter 3

Neg-,2 COCOA LATEST FOCUS FOR COMMODITY PACT NEGOTIATORS     By Douglas Learmond  Reuters     LONDON  March 16 - The credibility of government efforts to stabilise fluctuating commodity prices will again be put to the test over the next two weeks as countries try to agree on how a buffer stock should operate in the cocoa market  government delegates and trade experts said     Only two weeks ago  world coffee prices slumped when International Coffee Organization members failed to agree on how coffee export quotas should be calculated This week  many of the same experts gather in the same building here to try to agree on how the cocoa pact reached last summer should work     The still unresolved legal wrangle surrounding the International Tin Council ITC  which had buffer stock losses running into hundreds of millions of sterling  is also casting a shadow over commodity negotiations     The ITCs failure has restricted negotiators ability to compromise as governments do not want to be involved in pacts with built-in flaws or unlimited liability  but want clear lines drawn between aid and trade     A more hopeful sign of cooperation was agreement on basic elements of a new International Natural Rubber Agreement in Geneva at the weekend     Some importing countries insist the International Cocoa Organization ICCO buffer stock rules must not be muddied with quota type subclauses which might dictate the type of cocoa to be bought One consumer country delegate said this would distort  not support the market     Trade and industry sources blame uncertainty about the ICCO for destabilising the market as the recent collapse in coffee prices has made traders acutely aware that commodity pacts can founder On Friday this uncertainty helped push London cocoa futures down to eight month lows The strength of sterling has also contributed to the recent slip in prices     The ICCO daily and average prices on Friday fell below the must buy level of 1 600 SDRs a tonne designated in the pact  which came into force at the last ICCO session in January but without rules for the operation of the buffer stock     Consumers and producers could not agree on how it should operate and what discretion it should be given The agreement limits it to trading physical cocoa and expressly says it cannot operate on futures markets     A cash balance of some 250 mln dlrs and a stock of almost 100 000 tonnes of cocoa  enough to mount large buying or selling operations  were carried forward from the previous agreement     Members finance the stock through a 45 dlrs a tonne levy on all cocoa they trade It has an upper limit of 250 000 tonnes     The key arguments being faced by the ICCO working group on buffer stock rules which is meeting today and tomorrow will be over non-member cocoa and differentials the buffer stock should pay when trading different types of cocoa Another working group is scheduled to meet Wednesday to discuss administrative matters  and the full council meets on Thursday     Producers have so far maintained that buffer stock funds should not help mop up surplus cocoa produced in non-member countries such as Malaysia     Consumers say when this cocoa is the cheapest the buffer stock should buy it rather than compete with chocolate manufacturers for premium-priced high quality cocoas     The argument over buying non-member cocoa is closely linked to the one over differentials for different qualities     European industry and trade advisers have suggested as a compromise that the buffer stock have a maximum share that can represent non-member cocoa and that it use the London futures markets existing differentials for different qualities     Currently  good West African cocoa is tendered at par onto the London market     Discounts  which are currently under review  range up to 50 stg a tonne for Brazilian and Malaysian cocoa     Consumer delegates said the same arguments in reverse would operate when prices are high - the buffer stock should sell the highest priced cocoa in most demand  forcing all prices lower     The January talks were slowed by a split inside the European Community  a key ICCO consumer group  with France siding with producers EC representatives met in closed session in Brussels on Friday in an attempt to reach a common ground and  a diplomatic source said  narrowed the range of positions among the 12 nations     The source said the EC will be looking for signs of flexibility on the part of producers in the next few days and will be able to respond if they are there     One ICCO delegate describing the producerconsumer split said consumer proposals mean buying more cocoa for less and backs the concept of the pact which is meant to support the market where trade buying is not     In contrast  he said  producers seem to want to sell their cocoa to the buffer stock rather than consumers     Other  more technical  issues still outstanding include whether the buffer stock should buy at a single announced posted price as in the previous pact or by announcing it is buying then accepting offers     In either case  delegates said  it is accepted that producers must be given a clear opportunity to make offers of cocoa for forward shipment directly to the buffer stock in a way that is competitive with spot offers made by dealers  REUTER 3

Neg-,2 TRADE INTERESTS READY FOR FIGHT IN US CONGRESS     By Jacqueline Frank  Reuters     WASHINGTON  March 16 - US lawmakers are gearing up for a showdown between protectionists and free traders as a major trade bill winds its way through committees to a vote by the full House of Representatives in late April     In a move to toughen US enforcement of trade laws  a key House subcommittee last week approved a toned down version of legislation to require President Reagan to retaliate against foreign countries that follow unfair trade practices     This bill will be the cornerstone of congressional efforts to restore competitiveness of American industries and turn around last years record 169 billion dlrs trade deficit     Several lawmakers have argued the new trade bill made too many concessions to Reagan and said they intend to back amendments to get tough with countries that violate trade agreements or keep out US products      On the other hand  congressmen known for their allegiance to free trade  said the bill ties Reagans hands too much in trade disputes and they will seek to restore his negotiating powers     Republican Bill Frenzel of Michigan said the subcommittees bill was not one that a free trader like me could endorse in all respects  but he emphasized there was a consensus among trade lawmakers to work toward a bill Reagan and Republicans would ultimately endorse     Frenzel said the goal of trade legislation was  to make our trade policy stronger without violating our international trade agreements Youll find a lot of people who think we have not done the former enough Youll find poeple who think we havent avoided violating agreements     In a key concession made at the urging of the powerful chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee  the trade subcommittee backed off a requirement that would have forced Reagan to automatically impose quotas or tariffs on imports from countries that engage in unfair trade practices     It also agreed he may waive any retaliation if it would hurt the US economy     Ways and Means chairman Dan Rostenkowski  an Illinois Democrat  insisted the more moderate approach was necessary if the House wanted to pass a bill Reagan would sign into law     Reagan last year had blocked Senate consideration of a tough House trade bill he branded as protectionist and this year only reluctantly agreed to support a trade bill when he saw Democratic leaders were determined to pass a bill     As an indication of his success  White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters Friday the administration still did not like some provisions But he added  Generally we feel very good about the bipartisan consideration of the trade legislation I think we are progressing very well     The first battle will take place next week when the full House Ways and Means Committee considers an amendment by Rep Richard Gephardt  a Missouri Democrat  to force countries such as Japan  South Korea and Taiwan to cut their trade surpluses with the United States     The subcommittee limited the Gephardt plan to provide only that the existence of a large trade surplus with the United States will trigger an investigation of unfair trade practices  but would not automatically set off retaliation     Rep Phil Crane  an Illinois Republican and staunch free trader  said he will try to further weaken the Gephardt plan     Organized labor has pressed lawmakers for more relief from imports where jobs have been lost to foreign competition AFL-CIO president Lane Kirkland this year angered the administration in a statement that any trade bill Reagan would sign would not be worth passage in Congress     But Rostenkowski set the tone of the trade debate in a statement  Im not trying to write legislation to please Lane Kirkland Im trying to write legislation that will be signed by the president     In writing the bill  the subcommittee rejected calls for trade relief for specific industries such as textiles     Rep Ed Jenkins  a Democrat from Georgia  agreed to hold off his fight He intends to push separately a bill to protect the domestic textile and shoe industry  an aide said Reagan vetoed a similar measure last year     House Speaker Jim Wright  a Texas Democrat  is one of the most influential proponents of aid for specific industries beset by low priced foreign competition     Wright Thursday renewed his call for import relief for the domestic oil industry and announced his support for a Senate plan to trigger a temporary oil import tariff when imports reach half of domestic consumption     For the most part  the trade bills provisions toughen US enforcement of trade laws The bill forces the administration to act rapidly on complaints of unfair trade practices such as dumping products in the United States at prices below the cost of production     It also forces the administration to act rapidly when an industry complains that a surge in imports threatens its existence Congressmen said the change would have required the US International Trade Commission to impose limits on car imports in 1981  Reuter 3

Neg-,2 US MONEY MANAGERS MAY LEAN TO STOCKS VS BONDS     By Martin Cherrin  Reuters     NEW YORK  March 16 - US money managers and investment advisors said they expect stocks to continue to outperform bonds  but some are hedging bets by keeping roughly half of portfolios in bonds and cash for quick investment shifts     Merrill Lynch said its new asset mix report due today will urge weightings of 50 pct stock  35 pct bonds and 15 pct cash versus 40 pct bonds  35 pct stock and 25 pct cash previously     We believe an overweighting in stocks is warranted because of the positive momentum of corporate earnings  said Christine Lisec-Tinto  Merrill senior investment strategist     Lisec-Tinto  who formulated Merrills latest asset mix recommendations with new chief investment strategist Charles Clough  said there may be some consolidation of recent stock price gains  but the market appears to have good potential     Through Friday  stock prices as measured by the Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 1913 pct in 1987 Meanwhile  the  Shearson Lehman Treasury bond price index edged up 04 pct     We believe that the equity market has much more upside potential than the bond market  Chrysler Corp ltC treasurer Fred Zuckerman said He said interest rates are not coming down and I would not bet a lot that they will come down sharply     Chryslers 35 billion pension fund last week sold 405 mln dlrs of corporate bonds in the first of two planned sales of slightly less than one billion dlrs of corporates     Zuckerman told Reuters the proceeds will be used to buy stock to bring equities to 50 pct or more of the portfolio     A roughly even bondstock portfolio split also is urged by Wright Investors Service  with 425 billion dlrs under management  but it is more optimistic on bonds than stocks     Wed put half in bonds and half in equities now  said Judith Corchard  Wright senior vice president She said the bond share was lifted from 35 pct in the last three months     The stock market has appreciated sharply and discounted future corporate earnings extensively  Corchard said She said were worried about a stock price correction of as much as 10 to 15 pct within six  or possibly even three months     Meanwhile  Wright expects bonds to benefit from a half to one percentage point decline in interest rates by years end     At this level of the stock market  there is more of an advantage to being in long-term bonds than in equities  given our interest rate scenario  Corchard said     The stock market has come a long way in a short time Id be hardpressed to jump into stocks with the Dow near 2300 unless I was really convinced that earnings and multiples will increase  said a fixed-income securities portfolio manager at a major money center bank     He said the bank has kept bondequity portfolio mix fairly stable recently and probably will make no major changes for months as it awaits economic  oil price and dollar trends     Weve seen no real movement from bonds to stocks among our funds  said George Collins  president of T Rowe Price Associates  with 22 billion dlrs in assets under management     While he detected no rush into stocks from bonds  either among the many mutual funds under the T Rowe Price umbrella or among outside money managers  Collins thinks stocks are better investments than bonds at this time     In the near term  the stock market has more prospects for growth  due to the mixed signals on the economy so far  the slim chance the Federal Reserve will ease policy and still heavy debt accumulation  Collins said     He expects US stocks to improve further because there is more corporate earnings potential  nominal interest rates already are low and there is strong foreign demand for stock     Collins said that in funds which include bonds and stocks  the firm has long maintained an aggressive 75 pct weighting in equity with the rest in bonds and cash     Our equity managers have taken a slightly heavier cash position in equity portfolios lately  Collins said     Cash in portfolios usually means short Treasury bills which can be readily sold to allow rapid investment shifts     Many portfolio managers are working with relatively high cash positions in equity accounts  often 25 to 30 pct  given   the belief that there may well be downward price corrections enroute to higher ground     In bond portfolios  the money managers generally showed a preference for shorter term 10 years and under Treasury notes and  to a lesser extent  agency securities  rather than longer-dated Treasury issues and corporate bonds     Since yield premiums of corporate over Treasury bonds are now the lowest in years  many investors believe corporates are overvalued versus Treasury and agency issues Another negative cited for corporate bonds is the risk of hostile takeovers  leveraged buyouts and sudden ratings declines that does not exist with Treasury or Federal agency securities     Farm Credit paper was cited by some as undervalued and a good buy  despite the issuers well-publicized financial woes  Reuter 3

Neg-,2 DOLLAR VALUE APPROPRIATE  BUNDESBANK OFFICIAL SAYS     LONDON  March 17 - The dollar is near appropriate levels against European currencies and the yen  and a further fall could damage confidence in the currency while endangering world economic growth  a top Bundesbank official said     Board member Leonhard Gleske also told a Forex Association conference current exchange rates of major currencies can be viewed as equilibrium levels in a medium-term perspective     He said the recent Paris agreement on currency stabilisation and policy coordination between the Group of Five and Canada may herald an era of greater exchange rate stability     The Paris agreement was not  however  an attempt to set up permanent target zones for exchange rates  Gleske stressed  adding such targets would be extremely difficult to agree and enforce on an international level     At present levels the dollar can no longer be considered grossly overvalued in relation to the European currencies and the yen  Gleske said     He said the dollar had fallen much less against currencies of important trading nations such as Canada  Korea  Taiwan and Hong Kong  and further falls there may still be necessary     But a further dollar depreciation against major European currencies and the yen may not be the best way to restore the dollar to a fully competitive position  as measured by its weighted external value  he said    In fact  a further marked decline in the dollar rate would hold two major dangers  Gleske said     First  in countries with large balance of payments surpluses such as Japan and West Germany  it threatened to hamper economic growth and thus slow down the expansion of real income and domestic expenditure necessary to wipe out surpluses     Second  in the United States  it could damage investors confidence in the dollar and thus reduce their willingness to finance huge fiscal and external payments deficits  Gleske said     Gleske also was strongly sceptical that an international system of binding target zones for currencies  fluctuating in narrow bands against each other  can be established Such targets threatened to cause policy conflicts  both within countries and between them     For instance  the US Reliance on foreign capital to fund its deficits requires interest rates there be set at high levels  but domestic considerations call for low ones     If target zones were established  this would put pressure on other countries to reduce their interest rates even more  even though this may be in conflict with their own domestic situation and priorities  he said     Gleske added  targeting the exchange rate even within a wide margin will meet with serious objections where there is a clearly perceived potential for conflict between domestic and external policy priorities     Commenting on the Paris currency accord  Gleske said its chances of stabilising exchange rates rested heavily on current interest rate differentials being maintained     These chances seem to me to rest critically on the expectation that the current configuration of interest rates  and the monetary policies behind them  will assure smooth financing of current account imbalances in the months ahead     Gleske said past experience of currency adjustments had learned that markets are inclined to be impatient and will thus tend to overshoot He said this would seem to be unnecessary and should be avoided if at all possible     Monetary policies can help achieve this  but only if markets believe that pledged changes in fiscal policies will lead to balanced international payments  he said  REUTER 3

Pos-gold,2 NEW MARKET EMERGES IN WARRANTS FOR GOLD     By Donald Nordberg  Reuters     ZURICH  March 19 - A new market has emerged in warrants to buy gold  a vehicle which bankers say brings some of the play of commodity options into the field of securities     Over the past three weeks  Swiss offices of American banks have launched a total of four issues of warrants with varying conditions  drawing on renewed inflationary worries and the recovery of the gold price last year     And Credit Suisse and Credit Suisse-First Boston each issued Swiss franc bonds with warrants for gold which have a similar character  though they are aimed at a less professional market     The market is still small Taken together  the four American-led warrant issues raised only about 50 mln Swiss francs     But banks believe the vehicle meets a need of investors and predicted a lively future     Andrew Barrett of Citicorp Investment Bank Switzerland AG said The warrants give smaller investors a chance to have a long-term investment in gold with limited risk     Citicorp in Zurich launched the first of these warrants on February 27  following it up with a second issue less than a week later The issuer in both cases was Citibank NA     The idea found some quick copies Goldman Sachs in Zurich organized and co-led an issue for the Swiss branch of Banque Indosuez on March 9 and last night Morgan Guaranty Switzerland AG did another for Morgan Guaranty Trust Co of New York     The four issues now offer investors striking prices for gold ranging from the Indosuez issue at 410 dlrs an ounce  the same price as the underlying commodity  to a 430 dlr level on the first one for Citibank     The premiums range from 22 pct to 36 pct and maturities from 18 months to four years and three months  in all cases longer than gold futures and options on US Markets     The bankers traced the inspiration for the market back to the February report of US Consumer prices for January  when a jump of 07 pct raised again the threat of inflation     Many people are worried about inflation again  said Mats Joensson of Goldman Sachs Money supply in Germany and the United States has grown very strongly in the last year and people want to take a ride on gold     The gold market  having seen strong gains in 1986  has languished just above 400 dlrs an ounce over the past few weeks But the banks saw in warrants the vehicle for a more highly leveraged play where the downside risk was limited     Barrett said it was natural that the market developed in Switzerland People here understand gold  and they understand warrants  he said     Citicorp Switzerland pioneered warrants with a series of equity-linked covered issues based on Japanese company shares over the past two years  and last autumn  Swiss banks launched covered warrants in Swiss registered shares in a bid to give foreign investors a chance to play in a market otherwise closed to all but Swiss citizens  and to play it with higher leverage     But after a quick flurry of issues  that market dried up when Swiss shares prices fell from their January peaks     The issues are being marketed not on the basis of simple premiums  but on implicit volatility models devised to provide scientific comparisons between titles in the options market     Martin Bachem of Morgan Guaranty said his banks issue was competitive despite its relatively high premium The issue  for five ounces at 425 dlrs  was priced at 955 Swiss francs  making a premium over the spot gold price of nearly 36 pct     Using a Black Sholes options model  he said the issues long  43-year maturity meant the warrants needed an implicit volatility of gold of only 245 pct for the option to pay off  which he claimed was lower than the other issues     But Barrett said the Black Sholes variant Citicorp used pointed to a higher volatily for the Morgan issue and emphasized that the models were at best an inexact science     And each bank  using its own model  put the implicit volatility needed for its own issue at close to 25 pct     Whatever the calculation  the issues have received a warm welcome from investors     Joensson of Goldman Sachs said there was a lot of demand  even among small investors  who were buying 15 or 20 warrants apiece The most sophisticated ones wouldnt buy these because the premiums are too high  he said  REUTER 3

Neg-,2 UK MONEY DATA MAY EASE RATE CUT  ANALYSTS SAY     By Geert Linnebank  Reuters     LONDON  March 19 - Slower than expected growth in Britains narrow M0 money supply measure in February will help spur a further cut in UK Interest rates if a surge in sterlings value requires such a move  economic analysts said     M0  the only targeted money supply measure left after Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson scrapped the official target for the broad sterling M3 measure in his 1987 budget speech on Tuesday  fell an adjusted 34 to one pct in February     On an annual basis  this put M0 growth at four to 4-12 pct  in the middle of the 1987 target of two to six pct     The M0 data are much better than we expected  said Robert Thomas  economist at Greenwell Montagu Securities     He and other analysts said while the better than expected M0 figures alone would not be sufficient to trigger a new interest rate cut  they removed an obstacle to such a move     Thomas noted the rise in M0 had been kept in check despite buoyant retail sales in February  advancing an adjusted 22 pct after a fall of the same size in January     Analysts said the M0 measure  reflecting variations in consumer demand rather than real inflation prospects  was not an adequate indicator to determine interest rates     The authorities still seem to want to pretend that M0 is important  In practice  it is likely to be the exchange rate and the election which call the tune  Lloyds Merchant bank chief economist Roger Bootle wrote in a budget comment     Richard Jeffrey  economist at stockbrokers Hoare Govett  said in a comment It is unlikely that Lawson will respond to signals from M0 alone  Reinforcement from exchange rate trends is necessary before action is taken     With the Chancellor making clear that policy manoeuvres are made in response to signals from this narrow money variable  the City has been forced to take it seriously  he added     Noting this point  Thomas said market fears at the end of last year of an M0 overshoot had now disappeared     This removed a potential obstacle to a further cut in UK Base lending rates if foreign demand for sterling pushed up the pound above unofficial targets  analysts said     Such targets are believed to have been secretly agreed between finance ministers of the Group of Five and Canada at their Paris meeting last month  they added   UK Base rates have been cut twice by half a point since the Paris agreement  once on March 11  and again yesterday when foreign demand for sterling surged in reaction to a sharp cut in 1987 government borrowing targets contained in the budget     They stand at 10 pct now  and foreign exchange dealers and analysts expect them to shed another half-point in the coming week     Analysts shrugged off as largely irrelevant a higher than expected increase in February sterling M3  which pushed the annual growth rate to almost 19 pct  well above the previous target of 11 to 15 pct     Thomas said the February figures seemed to indicate the improvement in sterling M3 growth witnessed over the past few months had been reversed  but firm conclusions could only be drawn after revised data are released on March 31     Some analysts said foreign investors had long ceased to watch the sterling M3 target  and Lawsons move to scrap it altogether earlier this week removed whatever was left of its credibility as a key factor in monetary policy  REUTER 3

Neg-,2 NATURAL GAS SEEN RECAPTURING SOME MARKET SHARE     By NAILENE CHOU-WIEST  Reuters     NEW YORK  March 17 - Higher crude oil prices will raise demand for natural gas  helping it to reclaim market share lost to heavy oil when prices plunged in 1986  analysts said     The analysts said that these efforts will be most successful in the industrial sectors of the economy with large and growing energy requirements     Natural gas stands a good chance to recapture the share of oil supplied to electric utilities that it lost to the residual fuel industry last year  Michael Smolinski  an energy economist with Data Resources Inc  told Reuters     An estimated 200 000 barrels per day of residual fuel went into the utilities market at the expense of natural gas last year when world oil prices plunged  Smolinski said      Assuming oil prices hold above 15 dlrs a barrel  national average gas prices delivered to the utilities at a projected 210 to 225 dlrs per mln Btu would be very competitive  Michael German  vice president of economic analysis at American Gas Association said     The average delivered prices at the end of January were 210 dlrs per mln Btu  compared with 326 dlrs a year ago     We expect natural gas to regain 250 to 400 billion cubic feet of demand in the overall energy market in the second and third quarter 1987  he said     In addition to price competitiveness  availability will be an important factor persuading energy users to switch to gas  Frank Spadine  senior energy economist with Bankers Trust Corp in New York noted     Spadine said the mild winter in many parts of the North American continent has led to a build up of gas inventories and less would be necessary to replenish underground storage this spring freeing gas for spot sales     These forecasts develop a strong counterpoint to the fears that natural gas suplies would be tight and prices significantly higher given a sharp decline in drilling last year     AGAs German contended that despite the drilling decline  much of US proved reserves could be brought to production quickly through developments such as the infill drilling which permits more wells to be drilled in proved reserve basins     Citing recent EIA statistics  German said  the gas surplus was likely to contract from three trillion cubic feet in 1986 to two trillion cubic feet in 1987  but the surplus would not go away until 1990     Smolinski of Data Resources agreed that the surplus would persist until 1990 While gas supplies may tighten in certain consuming areas  notably in California and in the Northeast US  an overall shortfall appeared remote  Reuter 3

Neg-,2 MAIN FEATURES OF NEW RUBBER PACT     GENEVA  March 21 - The new International Natural Rubber Agreement INRA  like the 1979 pact  will use a buffer stock as the sole instrument for market intervention -- excluding export quotas or production controls     The new INRA was adopted yesterday at a session held under the auspices of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development UNCTAD     In many respects the main features in the new pact resemble those contained in the present one     The reference price  currently 20166 MalaysianSingapore cts per kilo  will be maintained -- unless between now and October 22  when the 1979 INRA expires  the average of the daily market indicator price remains above the upper intervention may sell price 231 cts or below the lower intervention may buy price 171 cts for six months     If this happened -- but delegates said it was unlikely considering that the present indicator price averages 196 cts -- the price would be revised under the current accord by five pct or by whatever amount the International Natural Rubber Council decides     The new reference price would then be taken over for the new agreement     Under the same circumstances in the new pact the reference price would be automatically revised by five pct unless the Council decides on a higher percentage     Similarly  if buffer stock purchases or sales amounting to 300 000 tonnes have been made since the last revision  the reference price will be lowered or raised by three pct unless the Council decides on a higher percentage     Another change introduced in the new INRA is that price reviews will be held at 15-month intervals instead of 18     Those changes are intended to make the reference price more responsive to market trends     As in the present accord the may buy and may sell levels are set at plus or minus 15 pct of the reference price  and the must buy and must sell levels at 20 pct of it     The lower and upper indicative prices floor and ceiling prices will remain fixed at 150 and 270 cents  unless the Council decides to revise them at reviews held every 30 months     During the negotiations  consumers abandoned a proposal that the floor price be adjusted downward if the buffer stock  currently 360 000 tonnes  rose to 450 000 tonnes     The maximum size of the buffer stock in the new pact is the same as under the present one -- 400 000 tonnes  with provision for an additional contingency buffer stock of 150 000 tonnes     Under the new accord  the contingency buffer stock will be brought in at 152 cts to defend the floor price     At last Fridays session  Ahmed Farouk  speaking for producers  said producing nations considered that the 1979 pact had served the purpose for which it had been created     Gerard Guillonneau of France  who spoke for consumers  agreed that the current agreement had worked relatively well     Asked about the chances of success of the new INRA  delegates noted that for nearly its whole life  the 1979 accord had maintained the average price above the must buy level     They said the agreement until now did not appear to have encouraged excessive production of rubber     In addition  provisions for borrowing to finance the buffer stock have now been eliminated  ruling out speculation It is a sort of middle-of-the-road agreement  one delegate said     The new pact will be open for signature at UN Headquarters in New York from May 1 to December 31 this year     To become operational  it will require ratification by countries accounting for 75 pct of world exports and 75 pct of world imports     Delegates estimate that this will take 12 to 14 months from now During the hiatus between the two agreements  the International Natural Rubber Council will remain in place     The pact will enter into force definitively when governments accounting for 80 pct of world exports and 80 pct of world imports have ratified it  REUTER 3

Neg-,2 US ECONOMY SHOWS PROMISING SIGNS OF GROWTH     By Donna Smith  Reuters     WASHINGTON  March 24 - The US economy is showing some promising signs of accelerated expansion despite the sluggishness of the fourth quarter last year  private economists say     Some of the slowness experienced in the October-December period had been expected to spill over into the first quarter this year  as the tax law changes that went into effect in January slowed business and consumer spending     But some of the latest economic data show signs of surprising strength in the US economy  although some economists remain cautious about the outlook     The Commerce Department reported today that new orders for durable goods in February jumped by 57 billion dlrs  a six pct rise  to 1012 billion dlrs Even excluding volatile defense goods  durable goods orders rose a healthy 38 pct  the agency said     The February numbers surpassed the expectations of many financial analysts  whose predictions ranged from flat to increases of up to five pct     The JanuaryFebruary employment statistics suggest the Gross National Product will show a healthy rate of growth for the first three months of this year  said Lyle Gramley  an economist with the Mortgage Bankers Association     The US jobless rate in February and January was 67 pct  the lowest rate since March 1980 The number of new non-farm jobs rose by 337 000 in February after a 319 000 gain in January and a 225 000 December increase  the government said     The employment data suggests a GNP annual growth rate of about three to 325 pct in the first quarter  said Gramley     Much of that will be attributed to businesses rebuilding their inventories and is not likely to be sustained in the second quarter  Gramley said He expects a slowdown in the second quarter with smaller increases in personal consumption and government spending He also sees residential construction declining mostly for multi-family housing units     Fidelity Bank senior economist Mickey Levy said some of the fourth quarter slowness will continue     Levy predicts GNP will grow at a scant 15 pct rate in the first quarter of 1987  accelerate during the second quarter and show a brisk 45 pct annual rate in the third quarter     The key to both forecasts is a marked improvement in the US trade balance which is expected because of the decline in the dollars value over the last year and half     The improvement will be gradual and long lasting  Levy predicted Most of it will be through import reduction  but at least one-third will be due to a rise in product exports as the prices of US goods become more attractive overseas     The Reagan administration has predicted the trade deficit  which soared to record levels last year  will improve this year and the US economy will grow by a respectable 32 pct for the year compared with a 25 pct rate last year     As part of the effort to reduce the trade deficit  the US has been pressing West Germany and Japan to stimulate their domestic demand for goods from the US and others     US officials believe that would help take some of the pressure off the United States whose five years of economic growth has been the mainstay of developing countries     The US economy provided them with a giant market for their goods giving them a way to earn income badly needed to service their foreign debt     The government last week said the US economy grew at a modest 11 pct annual rate during the fourth quarter     There were indications of improvement in the huge imbalance between the volume of goods imported to the United States and those shipped abroad The report showed a rising volume of exports corresponding to a decline in imports despite the fact that in current dollar terms  the US trade deficit worsened during the closing three months of 1986     While fourth quarter economic growth was weak  corporate profits jumped a healthy 61 pct during the period  the government said It also reported that inflation  as measured by the GNP price deflator  remained in check  growing a moderate 07 pct in the period  the lowest rise in 19 years     The government also reported that consumer spending  a key element of the five year economic recovery  jumped 17 pct in February  after falling two pct in January     The Federal Reserve Board also reported that the manufacturing sector  which had been one of the weaker elements of the US economy  was showing signs of recovery     In its latest report on current economic conditions  the Fed said that economic activity in the various regions of the country ranged from uneven or steady to improving Manufacturing activity showed signs of improvement in most regions except Dallas where orders remained sluggish     Chase Econometrics Chairman Lawrence Chimerine said the pick up in the US manufacturing sector is largely due to the drop in the dollars value He said he does not foresee a major pick up in economic activity  but does not believe the economy will slip into recession either     He said higher prices on imported products and wage cuts that have helped the manufacturing sector will squeeze consumers purchasing power     That pattern is starting and will continue for a number of years  Chimerine said He sees economic growth hovering around a modest two pct level for the next few years

Neg-,2 ENERGYUS OIL OUTPUT     By ROBERT TRAUTMAN  Reuters     WASHINGTON  March 25 - Energy Secretary John Herrington has proposed several ways to boost US oil production  but he said all would cost the Treasury money and will come under close White House scrutiny before action is taken     One measure he said he favored would raise the depletion allowance to 275 pct on new oil and gas production as well as production using enhanced extraction methods     Herrington said such a plan would cost 200 mln dlrs a year The White House  reacting  said it did not favor amending the tax code  but would look at the proposal     Herringtons proposals to spur production were made along with the release last week of the energy departments report on energy and the national security     The report said US oil imports  rapidly rising  could hit 50 pct by the mid 1990s and have potentially damaging implications for national security     He has said since in speeches and at news conferences that any plan he would back to spur lagging domestic oil production would have to meet three criteria--increase production  not cause economic dislocation  and be low cost to the taxpayer     Herrington said an import fee would meet the first test  spurring production but fail the second and third     He said it would raise production and return 120 000 oil  workers to their jobs  but at the same time it lifted oil prices  the higher prices would cost 400 000 jobs nationwide and cut the gross national product by 32 billion dlrs     A tax on gasoline  he said  would fail the first criteria by not increasing domestic production     In any case  US officials say  President Reagan remains firmly opposed to an import fee and a gasoline tax     Options which meet Herringtons criteria include     - Loan-price guarantees to shield banks from defaults by borrowers because of lower oil prices It was estimated that if oil fell to five dlrs a barrel it could trigger defaults that could cost the government an estimated 15 billion dlrs     - A five pct tax credit for exploration and development It would raise oil and gas production the equivalent of 325 000 barrels a day  at a cost of 740 mln dlrs a year     - A five pct credit only for geological and geophysical expenditures It would increase production by 80 000 barrels a day  at a cost of 65 mln dlrs     - Lower bid minimums on outer continental shelf acreage to spur exploration A drop from the present 150 dlrs per acre for the typical 5 760 acre tract to 25 dlrs per acre would lower the cost of the standard tract lease to 144 000 dlrs     Herrington also pressed anew for existing Administration proposals to deregulate natural gas  which he said would cut the need for imported oil by 300 000 barrels daily     He also called again for Congressional approval to explore off the continental shelf  which may hold more than 12 billion barrels of oil  and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge  which may hold nine billion barrels     Herrington said he understood the Reagans reluctance to  amend the newly enacted tax code to fund some of these proposals  but added he hoped his departments energysecurity study would make a strong case for the need to help the struggling domestic oil industry     Another move Herrington said he will press anew  even though it had been rejected earlier by the White House  is to raise the fill-rate for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to 100 000 barrels a day from its planned 1988 rate of 35 000     This  he said  would further bolster national security in case of an oil-supply disruption      Reuter 3

Neg-,2 IWC SAYS EFFECT OF LOWER SUPPORT PRICES LIMITED     LONDON  March 26 - Efforts by governments to control wheat surpluses by cutting support prices have met with only partial success  the International Wheat Council IWC says in its latest monthly report     Faster results could be achieved by a policy of reducing both price and areas  as employed in the United States  the IWC says in a survey of support prices in the five main wheat exporters - Argentina  Australia  Canada  the EC and the US     In some countries  for example Australia and Argentina  which are highly dependent on wheat shipments for export income  there may be problems in reducing production     A policy of cutting wheat production could lead to unemployment  with job prospects outside agriculture limited Alternative crops may offer inferior returns which could then lead to lost export revenue and balance of payments problems     The IWC outlines three courses of action open to governments in wheat exporting countries     They could continue to support prices in the hope that when the world economy improves demand for wheat will rise and surpluses wil be reduced or eliminated     Alternatively  support could be limited to wheat which could be easily sold  without needing to be stored for a long period     This option may prove to be the most politically unattractive and would result in many producers abandoning wheat production  the report said     The third option would be for governments to distinguish between the commercial and social aspects of agriculture  possibly varying support prices according to farm size or overall production     The IWC review covers support prices in the major exporting countries since 1982 At some time during that period all the producers cut support prices in response to growing surpluses     These changes did not always result in lower export subsidies as on several occasions currency fluctuations more than offset lower prices in the domestic currency     For example between 198586 and 198687 the EC intervention price for bread wheat fell from 20930 to 17944 European currency units Ecus It dollar terms  the currency in which most export transactions are denominated  the intervention price however rose to 193 dlrs from 168 The high cost of supporting farm prices has put a strain on national exchequers and some governments are now searching for ways to cut expenditure  the report says     The proportion of world wheat output produced by the five major exporters declined in the period covered by the survey from 40 pct in 1982 to 35 pct in 1987 This was partly due to increased production in China and India     The period saw an upward trend in yields  although this was countered in the Argentina  the US And Australia by lower acreages     In Argentina a reduction in the sown area of about 20 per cent was put down to low prices causing producers to switch to other enterprises  particularly livestock while lower US Acreages are attributed to official incentives  REUTER 3

Neg-,2 OECD SEES MAJOR ADJUSTMENT FOR AUSTRALIA     PARIS  March 31 - Australia faces a major medium term adjustment to reduce debt and improve its economic performance  the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said in its latest annual review of the Australian economy     It said Australia had a current external deficit of 5-34 pct of gross domestic product  high and rapidly rising external debt equal to 30 pct of GDP  growing servicing costs and inflation above nine pct  far higher than that of other OECD countries     A major policy change in early 1985 helped lay the basis for sustained non-inflationary growth and external competitiveness had improved  but economic performance overall had sharply deteriorated since June 1985     A major shift of real resources to the external sector -- about 4-12 pct of GDP by 1990-91 -- was required for the economy to expand in line with potential  for employment to grow  and for the debtGDP ratio to stabilize  it said     Success depended on the setting of right policies including tighter fiscal policy  a reduction in the public sector borrowing requirement and on private sector behaviour     Looking ahead over the next 18 months  the OECD expected economic performance to improve  partly as a result of tighter fiscal and monetary policy  and a substantial improvement in trade volumes     It said positive GDP growth of three pct might be restored  the current external deficit could fall to some 4-12 pct of GDP by the first half of next year  while inflation was projected to decelerate to around five to 5-12 pct by mid-1988     Continued real wage moderation was essential to maintain the competitive edge created by the Australian dollars depreciation  and to maintain if not boost profit shares in order to encourage business investment     The report urged Australia to broaden its export base by developing viable and competitive service and manufacturing industries  and not count on a recovery of commodity markets to correct its external imbalances     It added Australia should reduce protection levels in manufacturing  even though faster trade liberalisation would no doubt hurt the most protected sectors of industry  REUTER 3

Neg-,2 ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - CHINA MUST PRESERVE FARMLAND     By Mark ONeill  Reuters     FENGBANG COUNTY  China  April 1 - If we go on using up farmland as we have done since 1980  there will be none left in 20 years to grow grain on     Xu Jinfeng  a middle-aged official in Fengbang village on the edge of Shanghai  sums up the dilemma China faces as it tries to feed its more than one billion people and at the same time let them get richer by building factories and new homes     China has to feed one quarter of the worlds population  but only one seventh of its land is arable     Sharp increases in farm output since 1979 turned China into a net grain exporter for the first time in 1985  and again in 1986     But the rapid industrialisation of the countryside which has occurred at the same time  has gobbled up arable land for factories and homes for peasants who can now afford them     Official figures show that China lost just under one pct of its arable land to other uses in 1985 and a slightly smaller amount last year It gained 26 mln new mouths to feed during the two years     We lost very little land prior to 1980 when the industrialisation began  official Xu said Since then  nearly all the families in the county have built new homes and many factories have gone up     Last year we lost land to a new railway line  Xu said But land losses in future should fall because nearly all families already have new houses  she added     The issue of land loss is a matter of major concern to the Peking leadership  which announced earlier this month that China will issue nationwide quotas for conversion of grain land for the first time this year     The present situation of abusing  occupying unlawfully  wasting and destroying land and land resources is serious  said an article in the official press explaining the new measures     It has resulted in great losses of cultivated farmland  it said China has a large population and its land resources are badly deficient     An official of the Shanghai city government said county authorities could approve conversion of only 03 hectares of arable land to other uses  while anything more than that must be approved by the city government    The Peking government faces another major obstacle in its efforts to ensure Chinas people get enough grain to eat The prices the state pays to farmers for grain are too low  making it more profitable for them to grow other crops     To offset this  the state offers farmers cheap fertiliser and diesel oil and payment in advance for grain it contracts to buy The state then sells the grain at subsidised prices to Chinas 200 mln city residents Rural factories also subsidise grain output  paying farmers bonuses to grow it     Some officials argue that the simplest solution to the problem would be for the state to raise city grain prices     Chen Zuyuan  Communist Party secretary of a village in the eastern province of Zhejiang  said the government listened too much to the demands of selfish city people and could raise city grain prices without any problem     But the government has ruled out a price rise Raising the price of grain would directly conflict with the goal of social stability  said a China Daily editorial this month     The Shanghai official said prices must be reformed over the long term We must be very careful We have a very large population which is used to price stability and will object to price rises  he said The problem is how to do it     The Shanghai official said a rise in grain prices might also affect the prices of hundreds of food products made with grain and consumed by city residents     In addition  the state faces the problem of inadequate investment by farmers in land and in grain in particular     The official press has reported that farmers fear farm policy may change and they are putting their new wealth into building graves  memorial halls for ancestors and homes     Under reforms introduced in the late 1970s  farmers sign contracts with the state requiring them to grow certain crops  but they have considerable freedom in how to use their land     As the expiration date of the 15-year contract is almost at the halfway mark  farmers are beginning to worry about the future  the China Daily said in an editorial last month     Their anxieties stem from the fact that they are allowed to use the land but not own it For most of the period of Communist rule  the land was organised into collectives where there was little room for individual initiative     New measures are needed to reassure them of the consistency of government policies and make them interested in long-term investment  the newspaper said  REUTER 3

Neg-,2 HEAVY RAINS DAMAGE ARGENTINE COARSE GRAINS CROP     By Manuel Villanueva     BUENOS AIRES  April 1 - Fresh  heavy rains caused further damage to the Argentine 198687 coarse grains crop in the week to yesterday  particularly in Buenos Aires province  trade sources said     They said the sunflower  maize  soybean and sorghum crops were damaged and yield estimates affected New production forecasts were made for all these crops     The rains over the weekend and up to yesterday registered more than 200 mm on average in western Buenos Aires and worsened the flooding in various parts of the province     The weather bureau said the rains  which in Buenos Aires have surpassed 750 mm in the last 30 days  could continue     The northeast of the country was also hit by heavy rains     In Corrientes province the rains also passed an average of 200 mm in some parts  notably the Paso de los Libres area bordering on Uruguay     In Santa Fe and Entre Rios provinces they were over 100 mm in places  in Misiones and San Luis 90 mm and in Cordoba 80 mm     The rains were less intense in Chaco and Formosa     Harvesting in areas not actually under water could also be further delayed due to dampness in the earth  the sources said     The excessive humidity might also produce rotting of the crops  further dimishing the yield  the sources added     Sunflower harvesting before the weekend rains reached 26 to 30 pct of the area sown in Santa Fe  Cordoba  La Pampa and Buenos Aires provinces     The production forecast for 198687 sunflowerseed has been lowered to between 22 and 24 mln tonnes  against 23 to 26 mln tonnes the previous week  making it 415 to 463 pct lower than the record 41 mln tonnes produced last season     The area sown was two to 22 mln hectares  down 299 to 363 pct on the record 314 mln hectares in 198586     The maize harvest advanced to within 26 to 28 pct of the area sown in Cordoba  Santa Fe and northern Buenos Aires It will begin in La Pampa within about 10 days  weather permitting     Maize yield this season is now estimated at 96 to 99 mln tonnes  against last weeks 99 to 101 mln tonnes  down 214 to 226 pct on the 124 to 126 mln tonnes at which private producers put 198586 production     The new forecast is 227 to 25 pct down on the official figure of 128 mln tonnes for last seasons production     The grain sorghum harvest reached 17 to 19 pct of growers targets  against 14 to 16 pct the previous week     The production forecast was reduced to between three and 33 mln tonnes  against 32 to 35 mln tonnes last week  214 to 268 pct down on last seasons 41 to 42 mln tonnes     The area sown with sorghum in 198687 was 123 to 130 mln hectares  down 103 to 152 pct on the 145 mln in 198586     The forecast for soybean yield this season was the least changed in relation to last week It was put at a record 75 to 77 mln tonnes  against the previous 75 to 78 mln tonnes     These figures are 42 to 55 pct higher than last seasons record of 72 to 73 mln tonnes  according to private sources  and 56 to 85 pct up on the official 71 mln tonnes     The adjustment to the production forecast is due to the rains and overcast conditions which have greatly reduced the sunlight needed for this crop  sources said     Producers fear estimates may yet have to be adjusted down further     The humidity could induce rotting and growers are still finding more empty pods due to excessively dry weather earlier in the season     Soybean harvesting is due to start in mid-April in southern Cordoba and Santa Fe and northern Buenos Aires  Reuter 3

want to raise the value of the two companies to be formed by splitting Diamond Shamrock     If we can get the price up to the value of the company  we will not be vulnerable to takeover pressure  said Charles Blackburn  Diamond Shamrocks president and soon to be chief executive officer of the new exploration and producing company whose name has not yet been decided He was visiting New York for talks with investors     After successfully countering a takeover bid launched by T Boone pickens in January  Diamond Shamrock said it would spinoff its refining and marketing operation into Diamond Shamrock Refining and Marketing Co before its April 30 annual meeting     Blackburn told Reuters  Our advisors told us that a split would give a better share value to investors and that the market would give better multiples for pure refining and marketing and exploration and production plays     The two companies are now in the process of organizing themselves to become pure plays  the executives said     Blackburn said the new company would be a pure exploration and production operation and that he was looking to divest non-oil and gas operations  particularly Diamond Shamrocks coal operations     Blackburn said that we are in talks about coal operations but I cannot discuss this further at this time     He said the company would have a debt-to-capital ratio of about 38 pct  which could be paid down over time     Blackburn said the company would seek to generate further internal savings from rationalizing operations and personnel reductions He has set a goal of 73 mln dlrs in internal savings and we need to get at least 20 mln dlrs of that savings in 1987  Blackburn said     I would rather describe this as savings coming from eliminating non-essential activities as we purify the exploration and production business     There are some people associated with those activities but it is more a matter of cutting and trimming rather than wholesale changes  Blackburn said     Blackburn intends to run a tight ship in which dividends will not initially be paid and the resultant savings invested into exploration and production     Our goal is to find 20 mln barrels a year in the US to replace our production and I think that we can do this at the level we intend to spend  Blackburn said     It might be more difficult to find more oil and more oil internationally at these levels  he added     Blackburn said that his new company would spend 75 mln dlrs in North America and 90 mln dlrs overseas  mainly Indonesia  in the search for oil and gas reserves     In 1986 Diamond Shamrock produced 82 473 mln barrels a day of oil with 83 pct of that from Indonesia  while gas output was 2656 mln cubic feet a day of which 98 pct was in the US     Blackburn said that he believed he could find oil to replace this production at low costs which were 497 dlrs a barrel worldwide and 388 dlrs a barrel in the US     Blackburn also said that the company would be willing to buy reserves  if we can find the right producing properties at the right price     Blackburn estimated that oil prices will average about 18 dlrs a barrel this year with average prices received for natural gas at 157 dlrs per thousand cubic feet     Blackburn said he currently estimates that at thee prices for its products the company will have a cash flow of about 280 mln dlrs     This will mean a net negative cash flow as we pretty much spend our cash flow to find more oil and gas     Blackburn said the company will search for both oil and gas almost exclusively in estasblished basins     Roger Hemminghaus  who will be chairman of the new Diamond Shamrock Refining and Marketing Co  which last year had sales of approximately 16 billion dlrs  told Reuters his company was taking on some

Neg-,2 IEA SEES ONE PCT GROWTH IN 1987 OECD OIL DEMAND     PARIS  April 5 - Growth in oil consumption in the Western industrialised countries is likely to slow to around one pct this year compared with 23 pct in 1986  the International Energy Agency IEA said     Oil use in the 24 countries of the OECD increased by around one pct in first quarter 1987 to 359 mln bpd  the IEA said in its Monthly Oil Market Report     Growth in OECD countries is expected to come primarily from transport fuels  as in 1986 But if average consumer prices are higher than 1986  the rate of growth for these fuels may be below last years 36 pct  it said     The IEA said that assuming crude oil and product prices stay close to current levels  some destocking by end-users can be expected If that happens  natural gas will also regain some of the market share it lost to heavy fuel in 1986  and there may be slightly less growth in transport fuels     IEA estimates on April 1 put oil stocks in the OECD area at 428 mln tonnes  representing 98 days of forward consumption This is about the same level as at the begining of the year     The agency said this flat trend is explained by the projected seasonal consumption decline in the second quarter of the year which offset a reduction in stocks     It said initial estimates indicate that company stocks fell by 12 mln bpd in OECD countries in the first quarter of the year This followed a small rise in January of 04 mln bpd but a decline of 15 mln bpd in February and 25 mln bpd in March     It is possible that final data will show a larger draw  particulary for March  it said As crude production also fell  there is likely to have also been a decline in non-reported stocks  particularly at sea  the IEA said     Company stocks on land in the OECD rose to 326 mln tonnes on April 1 against 316 mln on April 1 1986 Governments built up strategic stocks to 102 mln tonnes against 97 mln in the period     The year-on-year trend of government stock building is continuing with year-on-year company stocks also rising  more or less in line with consumption  after declining for five years  the IEA noted     Oil stocks on land in the US And Canada were put at 2066 mln tonnes on April 1  down from the 214 mln tonnes on January 1 and equivalent to 94 and 98 days of consumption  respectively     Oil stocks in Western Europe were 1474 mln tonnes on April 1  down from the 154 mln on January 1 but still equivalent to 94 days of consumption     World oil supply fell in the first quarter by about two mln bpd to 452 mln bpd from 472 mln bpd in last quarter 1986     This drop was mostly due to a decline in OPEC crude production to around 155 mln bpd in FebruaryMarch from 165 mln bpd in January and to the seasonal drop in exports from centrally-planned Economies  the IEA said     Total OPEC crude oil supply was 158 mln bpd in the first quarter  plus 14 mln bpd of NGLs  compared with 173 mln bpd of crude in the last three months of 1986 and 179 mln average for the whole of 1986 Supply from non-OPEC countries totalled 28 mln bpd  against 285 mln bpd in the fourth quarter 1986     A drop in Saudi Arabian output to a tentatively forecast 33 mln bpd in March from 36 mln bpd in February was the largest factor behind the OPEC production decline  the IEA said     Saudi Arabias Opec-assigned output quota is 4133 mln bpd  REUTER 3

Neg-,2 COCOA BUFFER STOCK MAY FACE UPHILL BATTLE - TRADE     By Jane Merriman  Reuters     LONDON  April 7 - The International Cocoa Organization ICCO buffer stock could face an uphill battle to halt the downtrend in world cocoa prices when it begins buying operations in the next few weeks  cocoa traders said     Traders said they believed buffer stock purchases could reach 75 000 tonnes in a matter of weeks without lifting prices significantly  given the amount of surplus cocoa overhanging the market The buffer stock may begin buying shortly as the ICCO 10 day average indicator price is now at 1 57803 Special Drawing Rights SDR per tonne  below the 1 600 must buy level     Rules governing buffer stock operations were agreed last month by the ICCO council Buying will begin once the buffer stock manager has completed preparations  traders said     Some traders said the buffer stock manager may delay buffer stock buying until mid or end-April when changes in months used to calculate the ICCO indicator may lift the 10 day average above the 1 600 SDR must buy level     The ICCO indicator price is calculated from the average of the second  third and fourth positions on the London and New York futures markets The daily price was 1 57761 SDR per tonne yesterday     Months used currently for the indicator are May  July and September  but these are set to change to July  September and December on April 15  prior to May becoming the New York spot month  traders noted     The introduction of December into the calculations may lift the daily SDR price as December is currently quoted about 75 stg above May on the London terminal market     But the buffer stock manager would have to wait for the higher daily price to feed through into the 10-day average  the indicator which governs his activities  traders said     The buffer stock manager is obviously looking at the implications of delaying until forward prices lift the indicator since it might mean he has to buy less cocoa  an analyst from a leading cocoa trade house said     Traders said the buffer stock purchases could reach 75 000 tonnes fairly quickly once buying starts If purchases reach this level within six months  buying is suspended pending an ICCO council review of price ranges But some cocoa market watchers said the buffer stock may benefit from recent forecasts for a poor Brazilian Bahia temporao crop at 15 mln to two mln 60 kilo bags against initial expectations of up to three mln     A lower than expected Brazilian crop may cut the 198687 world surplus to between 50 000 and 70 000 tonnes  compared with a recent forecast by the ICCO statistics committee of 94 000 tonnes  traders said     In these circumstances  the buffer stock may only need to buy between 20 000 and 30 000 tonnes to lift prices above the must buy level     But some dealers said the ICCO buffer stock rules may put constraints on how quickly and effectively the buffer stock manager can remove cocoa from the market     The buffer stock system of price differentials set according to quality and a 15 pct limit on purchases from non-members could limit the buffer stocks scope for action  dealers said     Most of the cocoa readily available to the buffer stock is nearby in-store material of Malaysian and Ivory Coast origin     But the buffer stock can only buy 15 pct Malaysian cocoa as Malaysia is not an ICCO member  while purchases of nearby cocoa can only reach 40 pct in any one day  which forces the buffer stock to buy some intermediate and forward shipment material     Limits on buffer stock purchases of nearby and non-member cocoa will reduce the impact on terminal prices which are pressured by the overhang of Malaysian material  traders said     Buffer stock purchases of forward shipment cocoa from quality producers such as Ghana will have only a limited impact on futures  but is likely to widen physical market premiums for this cocoa over futures     Ghanas premium to the terminal has risen to about 50 stg from 25 to 30 stg a month ago partly in anticipation of buffer stock buying  dealers said     The buffer stock may not help the terminal market  but will provide a backstop for quality cocoas  one trader said     Traders cautioned that views on the impact of the buffer stock were all prognostication and that no one could hope to predict accurately what the result would be Psychologically buffer stock buying should help prices  but since the buffer stock already holds a carryover of 100 000 tonnes from the previous cocoa agreement and the market is in surplus  dealers expressed doubts purchases can counter bearish pressure     In June the ICCO is due to discuss rules for a withholding scheme as an additional market support mechanism  REUTER 3

Neg-,2 DEFICIT CUTS SEEN UNABLE TO CURE TRADE DEFICIT     By Irwin Arieff     WASHINGTON  April 8 - Financial analysts say they are pleased with congressional moves to trim next years federal budget deficit but believe the actions will do little to help improve the US trade deficit or buoy the economy     The House of Representatives is expected to vote tomorrow to approve a trillion-dollar budget blueprint for the coming fiscal year that reduces the deficit by 38 billion dlrs     Similarly  the Senate Budget Committee has approved a plan that would cut federal red ink by about 37 billion dlrs next year         In terms of the economy  37-38 billion dlrs is infinitesimal  so cuts of this magnitude will have little impact on the economy and the trade deficit  said Stanley Collander  a Touche Ross federal budget policy analyst     At best  it will have a small positive effect  Collander said in an interview     Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker has repeatedly told Congress that cutting federal red ink would go a long way to help reduce the massive trade deficit and also help ease some of the downward pressure on the value of the dollar     The US government has attempted to remedy the trade imbalance by driving down the value of the dollar But Volcker has warned that a further fall in the dollars value is fraught with danger     Such a decline  he has said  could refuel inflation as imported goods become more expensive and chase away foreign capital needed to finance the federal budget deficit     In addition  in February  US officials meeting with other major industrialized nations in Paris agreed that the value of the dollar had dropped enough and that world exchange rates should be stabilized at around current levels     As part of that agreement  Japan and West Germany agreed to take steps to stimulate their economies and the United States agreed to cut its budget deficit     The alternative to driving down the dollar any further as a way to deal with the trade deficit  Volcker said recently  is to reduce US consumption  particularly federal spending     If you dont deal with the budget deficit  everything else you do is going to be counterproductive  Volcker said in recent testimony before the Senate Banking Committee     Volcker also said he would prefer to further tighten the governments purse strings than have the Fed tighten the credit supply if action was needed to fight inflationary pressures or to assure the continued flow of foreign capital into the United States     Analysts say that Fed tightening now could choke off the current modest economic expansion and threaten a recession     Kemper Financial Services economist John Silvia stressed that any deficit reduction was better than none     But he said the size of the cuts under consideration were  not enough to give the Federal Reserve Board the flexibility it needs to steer the economy or to keep the value of the dollar from plunging further in world exchange markets     Theres no doubt that some deficit reduction helps  but if your objective is to stabilize the dollar and perserve the Feds flexibility to conduct monetary policy  then the answer is  its not enough  Silvia told Reuters     The US trade deficit has become one of the governments most vexing and persistent problems     The 1986 deficit was 1698 billion dlrs and there is as yet little indication that this years figure will be any lower  though administration officials have predicted it will drop by about 20 to 30 billion dlrs by years end     In the past  Volcker has joked that he never lost sleep worrying whether Congress would cut too much fat from the federal budget     On the other hand  he also has made it clear he is not attached to the gradually declining deficit ceilings set for the 1986-1991 period by last years Gramm-Rudman balanced budget law     While the new law set a ceiling of 108 billion dlrs for next years federal deficit  both the House and Senate Budget Committees have conceded that their budget plans would fall short of the deficit reduction goal by about 25 billion dlrs     For political reasons  35 to 40 billion dlrs is about the most youre going to get out of Congress at the present time  said Touche Rosss Collander To do something more than that would be extraordinary  remarkable and very  very difficult     Collander said the real danger for Congress was to end up short of the deficit reduction goal set by its Budget panels     To an extent  this has become the minimum acceptable reduction level  he explained Anything less than that will now look like a failure to Wall Street     The budget plan now under debate on the House floor would lower an estimated 171 billion dlr deficit for the year beginning on October one to about 133 billion dlrs by cutting defense and domestic programs by 38 billion dlrs from their anticipated spending levels for next year     The Senate Budget Committee has called for a deficit of nearly 134 billion dlrs with about 185 billion dlrs in new  taxes and about the same amount in spending cuts  Reuter 3

Neg-,2 YEN SEEN RISING AFTER G-7 COMMUNIQUE     By Jeremy Solomons  Reuters     NEW YORK  April 8 - The yen is likely to start another uneven rise against the dollar and other major currencies because the Group of Seven communique contained nothing new  currency and bond analysts here said     Is that it I was expecting something more than that  said one trader at a major Wall Street securities company     Marc Cohen of Republic National Bank of New York said The market now has the impetus to drive the dollar lower again     The dollar hovered between 14550 and 147 yen in the days just before the talks Dealers restrained their underlying bearishness and squared positions ahead of Wednesdays meeting of the finance ministers and central bankers of the top seven industrialized nations in Washington     After more than four hours of talks  the G-7 issued a communique which merely reaffirmed the recent Paris agreements view that prevailing currency levels were broadly consistent with economic fundamentals and that exchange rate stability should be fostered around these levels     The dollar sank to 14475 yen in early Tokyo trading     They said that the dollaryen rate was broadly in line with fundamentals when it was 154 Now they are saying its in line when its at 146 Will this still be so at 138 or 130  asked Republics Cohen     Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa fuelled speculation about the amount of fluctuation the authorities are prepared to tolerate by saying that the current yen level is still inside the range agreed on in Paris in late February     Official statements in recent weeks had indicated that the key psychological level of 150 yen was at the lower end of the authorities permissible range     Dealers and analysts warned that the dollars decline would probably be uneven They anticipated a concerted effort to prop up the dollar and restrain the yen via a mixture of open market intervention and public comments     Shortly after the Tokyo market opened today the Bank of Japan was detected by local dealers buying moderate amounts of dollars The dollar rebounded to about 14520 yen     The sources said the market may also be wary of agressively selling dollars for yen before Tuesdays February US Trade data The figures are expected to show a deficit of 13 billion dlrs  from a provisional 148 billion in January     3

Neg-,2 INDIAN STATE COMPANY BONDS PROVOKE COMPLAINTS     By Ajoy Sen  Reuters     NEW DELHI  April 9 - Indias private businessmen say they have been placed on an unequal footing in raising money from the capital market because government companies are wooing investors by issuing more attractive tax-free bonds     Stock brokers and bankers polled by Reuters said although equity shares or debenture issues floated by private firms provide a higher return and shorter maturity  they are fast losing their popular appeal as they are liable to both wealth and income taxes     Brokers said many investors are transferring funds into government company bonds because of their tax-free status and easy transferability     About 100 private companies have postponed plans to issue equity shares and debentures in the first quarter of fiscal 198788 partly on account of fierce competition from public sector bonds  a merchant banker said     They included equity shares and rights issue worth one billion rupees planned to be issued this month by Tata Fertilisers Ltd  he said  adding the issue has been postponed indefinitely     The government bonds are making serious inroads on the private sector companies resources  said R P Goenka  president of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry     The discriminatory tax treatment should be done away with and equal facilities be provided to the two sectors to mobilise resources from the market which is common to both  Goenka said     A senior Finance Ministry official said government and private firms were free to compete to raise resources  adding it was not correct that public sector-issued bonds were preventing private firms from raising money on the stock market     Debentures and equity shares floated by private companies still account for at least 60 pct of total capital raised in stock exchanges  the ministry official said     A spokesman at Bombay stock brokers Batliwala and Karani said government bonds were valued at about 20 billion rupees or about 40 pct of 50 billion rupees raised by both government and non-government firms in the domestic capital market in 198687     The share was 35 to 40 pct of about 3695 billion rupees mobilised in 198586  he said To save taxes  commercial banks  mainly foreign banks  and some private companies  are investing their surplus funds in the tax free bonds  he said     Individuals who are very well off are also investing in the bonds to gain tax benefits while only small investors are going for equities or debentures floated by private companies on a selective basis  the spokesman said     The maturity period of government company bonds varies between seven and 10 years No wealth or income taxes are payable on nine pct seven-year bonds but those carrying 13 pct interest on 10-year bonds are subjected to income tax if interest amountM exceeds 7 000 rupees a year     Equity shares  the 14 pct non-convertible debentures and 125 to 14 pct convertible debentures issued by private companies are not exempted from either the wealth tax or from the tax on income earned from them     The government bonds are listed as securities but traded on Indias four major stock exchanges They can be sold freely on the stock market by simple endorsement while debentures can only be sold to the company after one year  brokers said     Government companies are trying to capitalise on a boom in the stock market since 198485 sparked by liberal tax concessions and reforms in exchange operations  brokers said     The National Thermal Power Corp  NTPC  was the first government company to issue the bonds to raise one billion rupees in January last year  breaking the monopoly of private companies on the capital market The seven-year NTPC bond was oversubscribed three times  brokers said     Official figures show bonds floated by government companies have been heavily oversubscribed More state companies have sought the Ministrys permission to issue them in coming months     NTPCs second bond issue at the end of 1986 raised 451 billion rupees against 12 billion originally permitted by the Finance Ministry     The Mahanagar Telephone Nigam mobilised 383 billion rupees last year against authorised 15 billion and last month the Indian Railway Finance Corporations record susbcription totalled 55 billion rupees against authorised 25 billion     In most cases  the government has allowed the companies to maintain the oversubscribed amount  brokers said     Goenka said that government bonds are making it increasingly difficult for private companies to launch new equity or debenture issues He said the government could at least fix a suitable limit on the funds to be raised through such bonds by the public sector     Merchant bankers said the government is pressing state companies to borrow from the public by reducing financial support to them     To ease its internal debt burden  the government has reduced the budgetary support to development investment in about 120 public sector companies to 6992 billion rupees in 198788 from 7792 billion a year earlier  official figures show  REUTER 3

Neg-,2 US SAID TO VIEW G-7 MEETING AS MAJOR SUCCESS     By Peter Torday  Reuters     WASHINGTON  April 9  - The United States  which has long sought Japanese action to stimulate its economy  appears to be satisfied Tokyos latest package is a major development and allows leading industrial nations to reaffirm their agreement to stabilize currencies     Monetary sources said they believed that US Treasury Secretary James Baker considered Tokyos package  announced yesterday  to be a major stimulation of the Japanese economy     But yesterdays statement by seven leading industrial powers endorses the yens rise from around 153 to the dollar  the level at the February 22 Paris Accord  to about 145 today     And the initial reaction of currency markets in the Far East demonstrates that financial markets are unconvinced that currencies yet reflect economic fundamentals  even though the countries appear to do so The yen sank below 145 at one point despite intervention by the Bank of Japan     Kiichi Miyazawa  Japans Finance Minister  said the movement since Paris was consistent with currency trading ranges the nations agreed to defend in the February talks     I would say that what has happened to the yen in the past several weeks was not outside the range we agreed to in the discussions in Paris  Miyazawa said yesterday     The supplementary budget worth about 3448 billion dlrs was announced by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party on the eve of Miyazawas departure for Washington  to attend yesterdays meetings of leading industrial nations     In a strongly worded statement terming the Japanese action extraordinary and urgent  the meeting reaffirmed the Paris Accord by noting that current exchange rates are within ranges broadly consistent with fundamentals  or economic reality     The Group of Seven -- the United States  Japan  West Germany  France  Britain  Italy and Canada -- therefore repeated their willingness to continue close cooperation to foster exchange rate stability     The cooperation agreement has resulted in concerted central bank intervention of 8 billion to 9 billion dlrs to halt the dollars fall While relatively unsuccessful  the scale of intervention between so many nations is unprecedented in recent years Monetary sources also said they understood that Secretary Baker considered the meeting to be extremely successful in the light of the Japanese announcement     They also said there was a growing feeling among the finance ministers and central bankers that cooperation over medium-term policies has replaced the bickering over short-term differences in past meetings     West Germany  whose currency has not risen anything like the yen since the Paris Agreement  appears from the face of yesterdays statement to have won acceptance from other countries that its exchange rate is acceptable     Bonns finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg argues that major currency shifts needed to remedy the huge imbalance between West Germany and Japans trade surpluses and Americas trade deficit have already taken place     No mention was made  however  of the US commitment to cut the budget deficit even though it is implied in the reafffirmation of Paris     European nations and Japan believe deficit cuts are essential to curbing the record US trade shortfall that reached nearly 170 billion dlrs last year     A similar argument was made on Capitol Hill earlier this week by Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker A further sharp fall to redress trade imbalances would clearly pose substantial risks of renewed inflationary momentum and could undermine confidence in future financial stability  he said     Volcker warned a further dollar fall might force the politically independent Fed to drive up interest rates     Monetary sources said that  privately  West Germany welcomed the rise in the yen against the dollar while its own currency remained relatively stable against the US unit     Bonn and other European nations worry that once the weak dollar blunts Tokyos export drive to the United States  the Japanese monolith will concentrate on European markets     The ministers  meanwhile  also continued talks on making their policy coordination more binding and one  Canadian Finance Minister Michael Wilson  said good progress was made     Wilson said they will meet before the June Economic Summit to prepare a report for the leaders of the seven nations     The United States and France  backed by the International Monetary Fund  want the seven to agree on ranges or norms for a limited number of economic objectives such as growth  inflation  monetary conditions  trade balances and current account balances     Sharp deviations from these guidelines would result in consultations between the countries on whether corrective action should be required     But the inclusion of currencies as one of the objectives has Bonn and London worried  monetary sources say  because it implies Washington is moving in the direction of target zones     The sources said the Reagan administration unsuccessfully sounded out its allies on a system of target zones to limit currency fluctuations just before the February meeting     The concept is a much more rigid one than the secret ranges of the Paris Accord and would mark a sharp departure from the relatively free currency markets of recent years

Neg-,2 SWISS AGREE ON NEW PROSPECTUS RULES FOR NOTES     By Peter Conradi     ZURICH  April 9 - Swiss franc notes issued after May 1 must be provided with a prospectus  virtually erasing the difference in information requirements between notes and public bonds  according to a convention drafted by the Bankers Federation     The convention requires that lead managers draw up a prospectus naming all syndicate members and providing certain details about the borrower     In contrast to public issues  though  the prospectus must merely be made available to clients on request via all syndicate banks rather than published and distributed in printed form     The convention  which was approved by banks earlier this month  replaces an earlier convention dating from 1984 and deals with what had been widely seen as an increasingly anachronistic distinction between notes and public issues     Its publication follows a long debate among bankers on the amount of information that should be provided by borrowers  heightened by difficulties with Swiss franc issues here on recent occasions      It applies to all notes in units of at least 50 000 Swiss francs  the usual denomination  which are placed directly with customers by the syndicate and not quoted on the bourse     Anything smaller than 50 000 francs will be governed by the unchanged  more demanding rules that apply to public issues     Bankers contacted by Reuters said they did not envisage that the new requirement would present them with problems or push up fees Many banks said that they had for some time been providing more than the legal minimum of information     Traditionally  notes or private placements  as they were also known  were medium term instruments denominated in 50 000 francs and placed largely with institutional investors     They were normally not brought onto the open market and never quoted on the stock exchange     But over the years the distinction between notes and the publicly quoted and traded bonds gradually broke down The National Bank therefore last May abolished all remaining restrictions on maturities and denominations which still formally divided them     However  it was not in the competence of the National Bank to rule on prospectuses and banks have since continued largely as before public issues  generally quoted on stock exchanges  have been provided with detailed prospectuses  while notes  virtually always not-quoted  have been equipped only with information memorandums with varying degrees of detail     The new convention attempts to put an end to this It says each notes prospectus must contain the following seven points     - The precise terms of the issue     - Details of the company performance if it is more than six months since the last annual report     - Naming of all guarantors     - The source of the information     - Details of ratings  insofar as they have been made     - For equity linked notes  details of where the companys shares are listed and price high and lows over at least the last three years     - That the lead manager has required the borrower to provide information during the lifetime of the notes on the progress of his business      According to figures from Swiss Bank Corp  total note issues by foreign borrowers reached 186 billion Swiss francs last year  compared with 236 billion francs borrowed in the form of public bonds     A majority of the note issues were for Japanese borrowers  REUTER 3

Neg-,2 CANADA TRADE RISE SEEN AS START OF RECOVERY     By Russell Blinch  Reuters     OTTAWA  April 9 - Canadas trade picture has brightened considerably  underscoring economists predictions the sector would post a long awaited recovery this year     The federal government reported today that the monthly surplus soared to 125 billion Canadian dlrs in February  double Januarys 623 mln dlrs surplus and sharply higher than February 1986s 189 mln dlr tally     Hopefully its the beginning of a trend  said Richardson Greenshields of Canada Ltd economist Susan Clark in Toronto     Economists generally dont expect such large gains over the next months  but are looking for an upward trend throughout the year     We thought the trade balance would improve  over the year  and it certainly looks as if this mornings figure is indicative of that  commented economist James Donegan at the Toronto securities firm of Midland Doherty Ltd     Statistics Canada reported the surplus was driven by a 23 pct gain in automobile product exports to a record 32 billion dls in the month     Recovery in the automotive sector helped push the value of exports up by 59 pct in February  the agency said in its monthly report     Total exports expanded to 1044 billion dlrs from 985 billion dlrs in February  while imports slipped to 919 billion dlrs from 923 billion dlrs     Economists have predicted the 1987 trade surplus would end up three to five billion dlrs higher than last years dismal 101 billion dlr total In 1985 the surplus was 1748 billion dlrs     Money market analysts said the positive trade news touched off a modest rally in the Canadian dollar  which rose to 7685 US cts on North American markets early this morning after closing at 7658 cts Wednesday     The currency was hovering around 7678 cts in early afternoon trading     Economists have been banking on an improved trade performance this year to stimulate an otherwise sluggish Canadian economy     Money market analysts said the positive trade news touched off a modest rally in the Canadian dollar  which rose to 7685 US cts on North American markets early this morning after closing at 7658 cts Wednesday     The currency was hovering around 7678 cts in early afternoon trading     Economists have been banking on an improved trade performance this year to stimulate an otherwise sluggish Canadian economy     They say the countrys consumers  who have been spending at a torrid pace in recent years  will sharply curtail outlays this year and this should help curtail the flow of imports into the country     Meanwhile  demand for Canadian exports in the United States  by far the countrys largest market  is expected to be strong as a result of a projected rise in American consumer spending and the relatively low value of the Canadian currency     We maintain whats going to drive Canadas export performance is income growth in the US  said Midlands Donegan     But at the Bank of Nova Scotia  deputy chief economist Warren Jestin was less optimistic about the US outlook and said it could be a mistake to read too much into Februarys trade upturn     Jestin said  Given the fact the US economy is showing signs of weakening--particularly car sales--it would indicate that part of the strength in Canadas trade figures is probably transitory  Reuter 3

Neg-,2 WEST GERMAN INSTITUTES CALL FOR EARLY TAX CUTS     BONN  April 13 - The five leading West German economic research institutes said the government should do more to stimulate economic growth and called for early introduction of tax cuts planned for 1990     In their joint spring report the institutes were divided about 1987 growth forecasts  with three predicting two pct expansion and the other two only one pct growth Gross national product grew 24 pct last year     But the report said all the institutes believed that more must be done to produce dynamic growth so that more additional jobs can be created     The institutes said any step which improved basic economic conditions should be taken as quickly as possible From this point of view  the tax reform planned for 1990 should be brought forward     The government plans gross tax reductions of 44 billion marks as part of the major tax reform The net tax relief from the tax reform will amount to 25 billion marks     However  the institutes criticised the government  not only for the timing of the reform  but also because the question of its financing had been left open     The government has not specified how the remaining 19 billion marks of the tax reduction package will be paid for  though it has said it wants to cut state subsidies     The institutes said this lack of clarity from Bonn had caused uncertainty among companies and households as to what exactly they would receive from the tax reform and urged a quick decision from the government     They also said the government should reduce tax preferences  which would simplify the fiscal system  urged a restriction of state spending and called for no increase in value-added tax     The institutes also criticised Bonn for increasing subsidies at a time further reductions had been pledged     They referred specifically to a doubling of special writedowns for small and medium sized companies announced in a package of tax adjustments planned for 1988 and described this as an increase in subsidies     The institutes said total subsidies  including tax preferences  had reached 80 billion marks in 1985 and risen further since then Given the scope of these subsidies  it should be possible despite  Major political difficulties to finance the tax reform by cutting state handouts     The institutes said that if the government raised value added tax or other indirect taxes a large portion of the positive effects resulting from lower taxes would be lost     The report also noted that the government was progressing only slowly with its plans to privatise state companies and said more deregulation was needed The government had to aim for more competition  it said  REUTER 3

Neg-,2 G-7 SEEMS WORRIED MARKETS IGNORE COORDINATION     By Peter Torday  Reuters     WASHINGTON  April 13 - Top officials of leading industrial nations appear deeply worried that financial markets have ignored their efforts to coordinate policies  which they believe they strengthened in talks last week     Monetary sources said officials were exasperated that the markets  which drove the dollar rapidly lower and severely disrupted bond and stock markets too  did not take heed of the policy commitments of the Group of Seven -- the United States  Japan  West Germany  France  Britain  Italy and Canada     Treasury Secretary James Baker went out of his way to reassure markets of his commitment to a stable dollar with a statement  and French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur underscored that by saying I dont believe at all that the Americans want a weaker dollar     West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said the dollars latest rapid descent involves the risk -- now already a tangible threat -- of a new strong surge of inflation  leading to a renewed rise in interest rates     But there were signs too  that while policymakers feared the market uproar  they seemed to accept there was little they could do until the economic picture changed  and currencies settled into a stable pattern as a result     Nor did there seem to be any enthusiasm at last weeks semi-annual meetings of the IMF and the World Bank for higher US Interest rates as the best way to curb the dollars rapid descent That distaste stems in part from fears of recession     Outgoing Deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman told television interviewers he did not think a policy of driving the dollar down would solve the US trade deficit     It would slow growth in Germany and Japan which would adversely affect our trade balance and ultimately it would drive interest rates up here which would throw us  if not into recession  into slower growth  he said     Asked if higher US Interest rates would stabilize the dollar  Balladur said When a currency is maintained artificially high  by artificially high interest rates  it is not healthy     And resorting to higher interest rates could lead to recession  he said     Acknowledging the dollars latest slide was now a fact of life  Balladur said  there may be adjustments of course in one or other currencies  this is not a fixed rate system     But Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker said he might rein in credit if the dollars slide deepens     US Monetary sources also said Washington wanted it understood by markets the sevens commitments were genuine     The United States and the six major industrial countries are fully committed to implementing our undertakings in these agreements  Baker told the meetings     Darman said Baker had been misinterpreted by markets which wrongly believed earlier remarks suggested he wanted a further decline in the dollar Baker  Darman said  was committed to stabilizing currencies at current levels     Last weeks statement from the seven reaffirmed a February 22 agreement in Paris in which the Reagan administration agreed to reach a budget deficit compromise with Congress and to fight protectionism     West Germany and Japan  meanwhile  agreed to stimulate domestic demand and lead a global upturn     Ministers believed the Paris pact was bolstered by Japans promise of a 35 billion dlr supplementary budget     The sources said they believed Baker saw it as a major action But the seven seem to accept their commitment to stable currencies applied to todays exchange rates and not those at the time of the Paris agreement  when the dollar stood higher     The Paris accord said  currencies are within ranges broadly consistent with underlying economic fundamentals  given the policy commitments summarized in this statement     Now they accept the dollars lower level  especially against the yen  as hard reality that is nonetheless consistent with the agreement The ministers and governors reaffirmed the view that around current levels their currencies are within ranges broadly consistent with fundamentals  last weeks statement read     Monetary sources said policymakers understood markets were focusing on instability created by the gap between the US Trade deficit and the surpluses of West Germany and Japan rather than prospective policy changes European monetary sources said Bonn was still unconvinced that Washington meant business with its commitment to cut the budget deficit  Reuter 3

Neg-,2 US BANKS LIKELY TO LIFT PRIME RATES AGAIN SOON     By Martin Cherrin  Reuters     NEW YORK  April 13 - Major US banks may lift prime lending rates again within days due to recent increases in their borrowing costs and speculation the Federal Reserve is nudging up interest rates to help the dollar  economists said     In what was the first prime rate boost since mid-1984  most banks in early April lifted their rates a quarter point to 7-34 pct  citing a reduced gap between the prime and their own cost of money That spread has narrowed again     A prime rate increase could happen as soon as tonight  said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International Inc     Brusca said a quarter-point prime rate rise to eight pct is justified because the spread between banks cost of funds and the prime rate has narrowed to less than three quarters of a percentage point     He said that spread had averaged around 14 percentage points since last October until it fell below one point and triggered the April prime rate rise at most banks     We could easily have another prime rate increase as soon as this week  said David Jones of Aubrey G Lanston and Co     Weve got a fairly good chance of a prime rate rise in the near future  said Allan Leslie of Discount Corp     Based on the spread between the prime rate and funding costs  you would ordinarily see a prime rate increase now  said Harold Nathan  economist at Wells Fargo Bank     However  he said banks may be reluctant to lift the prime because that would dampen already fairly weak business loan demand and because some are not sure the Fed will maintain recent upward pressure on money market interest rates     Nathan believes the Fed has let market pressures lift short-term rates in recent days to help the ailing dollar He said if there is widespread belief money market rates will stay high  a prime rate rise could occur at any time     Fed officials have long expressed concern that too steep a dollar drop could help rekindle US inflation As the dollar fell to a 40-year low against the yen Friday  currency traders said the Fed and other central banks supported the dollar     In addition to buying dollars outright  another way to stabilize the US currency would be for the Fed to push US interest rates higher relative to overseas rates     Based particularly on the Feds reserve management actions on Friday and today  Nathan of Wells Fargo said it has become clear that the Fed is not fully resisting upward rate pressure in the market It is supplying fewer reserves than are needed     Bank funding costs and other short and long-term interest rates rose sharply Friday and today on heightened speculation that the Fed is gently firming monetary policy     That was because the Fed supplied far fewer reserves in the market than most economists had expected     On Friday  the Fed added reserves indirectly and in small amounts via one billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements with the Federal funds rate at which banks lend to one another high at 6-516 pct With funds trading even higher at 6-12 pct today  the Fed arranged only a slightly larger 15 billion dlr round of customer repurchase agreements     The Feds actions on Friday and today show that it is offering only token resistance to upward funds rate pressures  said Jones of Lanston     The Fed is focusing its policy attention mainly on the need to defend the dollar  Jones said He believes it is merely shading policy toward restraint now  but to have a major impact on the dollar  the Fed will have to tighten policy overtly at some point     Jones expects the Fed to foster higher market rates by becoming more restrictive in supplying reserves and  within four to six weeks  to raise its discount rate from 5-12 pct     Jones said a US discount rate increase to six pct might well be accompanied by West German and Japanese rate cuts to further aid the dollar     Given likely Fed policy firming  he said both the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds about 830 pct now and the prime rate may be at 8-12 pct at end-June and nine pct by years end     The jury is still out on whether the Fed is tightening policy to defend the dollar  said Leslie of Discount Corp He said tax-date pressures have been pushing up Fed funds lately Leslie said Fed actions and reserve data once these pressures abate will show whether or not it is firming policy    Reuter 3

Neg-,2 BANKS TRY TO CALM MANILAS FURY OVER DEBT DEAL     By Alan Wheatley  Reuters     NEW YORK  April 17 - Senior US bankers are seeking to calm the furore in the Philippines caused by the terms of Argentinas new financing package  but a source in New York close to the Manila government said finance minister Jaime Ongpin is in no mood for compromise     Ongpin is angry because the banks granted Argentina an interest rate spread of 1316 pct  the same as Mexico won  just weeks after telling the Philippines that it must accept 78 pct because the Mexican margin could never be repeated     Bankers acknowledged the political sensitivity of the interest spread but urged Ongpin to examine the Argentine package in its entirety     Argentina  for instance  is offering banks a 38 pct participation fee if they sign up for the deal within 30 days declining to 18 pct if banks commit within 60 days  which boosts the all-in interest rate it is paying on the package     You can make the case that the deal is not 1316 pct  one banker said Another  referring to the Philippine debt negotiators  said The only reason theyd have to come back to New York is political  not economic     Ongpin has said as much himself  estimating that an extra 116 percentage point would cost just 51 mln dlrs a year     But the source close to the Philippines said Ongpins anger goes beyond the dollars He said the minister feels personally betrayed by bankers who insisted Mexicos 1316 pct was a rock-bottom spread that could not be duplicated Top US Treasury and Federal Reserve officials had said the same     The source said Ongpin is unlikely to come to the US to press his case and was expecting the Philippines bank advisory committee  headed by Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co  to negotiate the spread reduction by telex     Ongpin has not said the Philippines will unilaterally start paying interest at the lower rate but has made it clear to the committee in a telex that he is not prepared to pay more than Mexico and Argentina  the source said     The Philippines really means business on this I dont think theres much room for compromise  he said     Manufacturers Hanover declined to comment on the issue     The Philippines last month won an agreement to reschedule 103 billion dlrs of debt over 17 years at an interest rate of 78 pct  whereas some 30 billion dlrs in old Argentine debt will be stretched out over 19 years with a spread of 1316 pct     Bankers said they were forced to break their word because political circumstances had changed in the past few weeks     In particular  they said it had become clear that Argentina was serious about its threat to suspend interest payments unless it got a good deal Fearing that an Argentine moratorium would stiffen the resolve of its neighbour Brazil  which has already suspended payments  the banks  at the urging of the Reagan Administration  bowed to Argentinas demands     Some US bankers argued that  regardless of politics  the rich menu of options in the Argentine package makes it attractive enough to justify a 1316 pct rescheduling rate     When they the Philippines see the whole package  they may realize that this is not a Mexican deal  one banker said of the Argentine agreement     The Argentine pact contains several features that were not in the Mexican accord such as exit bonds  an option to provide new money via bearer bonds  a trade facility  onlending provisions and a debt-equity conversion scheme     Moreover  Argentina is requesting only 195 billion dlrs in new loans  compared with Mexicos 77 billion  and is paying 78 pct for most of the money instead of the 1316 pct charged to Mexico     This line of argument cuts no ice with the Filipinos  who note drily that they asked for no new money at all     The banks reacted on the level of politics to Argentina and try to justify it in terms of economics  and now theyre going to have problems with both the Philippines and Venezuela  said the source close to the Manila government     Because of the Easter holidays bankers have not yet got an official reaction from Venezuela  which is also paying 78 pct on its 202 billion dlr rescheduling But they acknowledged that Caracas  which was also told that the Mexico spread was inviolate  is quite likely to demand a lower spread     Bankers were more sanguine in the case of Chile     Because it is under fire for its human-rights record  the government of General Augusto Pinochet is unlikely to attract attention to itself by seeking to renegotiate its recent debt package  which carries interest of one pct  bankers said     They hope that  once tempers cool  the Philippines will also accept that reopening an agreement that took 4-12 tough months to negotiate will be more trouble than it is worth  Reuter 3

Neg-,2 UK CREDIT POLICY SEEN STEADY  DESPITE BANK DATA     By Sandy Critchley     LONDON  Oct 20 - An unexpectedly heavy 44 billion stg surge in UK September sterling bank lending is unlikely to nudge the Bank of England towards tightening monetary policy as long as sterling remains in its present robust state  economists said     An acute crisis of confidence in equity markets over the past two days will in any case subdue personal consumer credit demand which has largely been behind growth in lending     In the normal course of events the markets would have been extremely worried about that figure  noted Peter Spencer  UK Economist with Credit Suisse First Boston     After an initial dip in reaction to the bank lending data  which compared won stg August rise  UK Government bonds gilts soared as investors continued to flee from plummetting equities into the relative security of government securities     Equity markets dropped sharply on the news  touching a days low of 1 7667 on the FTSE 100 index after the data  before staging a recovery Sterling held its buoyant tone throughout     UK Money market rates  in a similarly calm response  resumed the slightly easier trend of earlier in the morning after little more than a token blip as the figures came out     Noting that such a huge rise in credit extended by banks would under other circumstances have prompted market fears of a rise in clearing bank base rates from the current 10 pct  With the financial markets doing what theyre doing  thats the last thing the Bank of England would want to do  Spencer said     The monetary situation is clearly very bad but as long as sterling is firm  the authorities are unlikely to put rates up  said Kevin Boakes  chief UK Economist at Greenwell Montagu Gilt Edged Boakes pointed to a rise in the narrow money measure M0 to 52 pct year-on-year from Augusts 45 pct growth  which he said must cause some concern at the Treasury     But The fact that overall broad money growth has slowed down is a rather encouraging sign  noted Paul Temperton  UK Economist with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets He pointed to a fall in the year-on-year growth rate of the M3 broad money aggregate to 195 pct in September from Augusts 22 pct     It was concern about credit growth which prompted the Bank of England to engineer a one point rise in UK Bank base rates to 10 pct in early August  caution endorsed subsequently by news of a massive 49 billion stg July rise in bank lending     Temperton noted that a particular focus of bank worry in that period had been the behaviour of UK Asset markets     Housing and equities were the key two asset markets in influencing consumer behaviour  he said     In the light of the precipitous falls on UK Equity markets in the past few days  There will almost certainly be a straightforward impact on consumer spending and on retail sales  Temperton said     Almost certainly we can look forward to slower growth in consumer borrowing if the equity shakeout continues  he added     I think the stock market has decided that the bank lending figure is a thing of the pastWe are talking about a very serious panic and a flight to quality  Spencer said     A UK Treasury official said that it was important to look at all the monetary information  not just the bank lending  adding that monetary aggregates were growing much more slowly than bank lending     Senior banking sources noted that the surge in bank lending was evidence of the continuing recent trend of fairly heavy personal sector borrowing     Figures from the Banking Information Service showed personal sector lending by UK Clearing banks rose by 166 billion stg in September after a 978 mln stg August rise Much of the rise reflected quarterly interest payments  REUTER 3
